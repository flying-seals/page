The main reasons for that were Kyma's existing open-source technologies that constitute its cornerstone, and the fact that it allows companies to extend and customize their enterprise applications using serverless computing or microservice architecture.\n\n<!-- overview -->\n\nInnovative companies are constantly seeking ways to identify and experience new technology solutions that can provide potential benefits to their businesses. Receiving feedback from such companies at the early stage was very valuable to the Kyma team. As a result, we could make the necessary improvements to the product and launch its refined version as an open-source project.\n\nBefore going open-source, Kyma was prelaunched to a selected group of companies. One of them was XXXLutz KG, one of the worldâ€™s top furniture retailers. The company representatives received privileged early access to Kyma and were encouraged to test it. If you are interested in the outcome, watch the video below where Christian Renner, the Chief Technology Officer of the XXXLutz Group, explains why they wanted to test Kyma and what their experience with the project was like.\n\n`youtube: https://youtu.be/NI4cOWO9HnA`\n\nGetting feedback and contributions from the open-source community remains our focus moving forward. Feel invited to start your very own Kyma journey:\n\n- [Install](/docs/root/kyma#installation-installation) Kyma and test it.\n- Explore the examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/kyma-project).\n- Share your feedback on [Slack](http://slack.kyma-project.io). \n- Join the Kyma community on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kymaproject) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/authwall?trk=ripf&amp;trkInfo=AQFL2ZrSEnYW9gAAAWd9pfdAKay9_IjJ5fE58rtE5CvgTVY1LQicYsSOd52ICurd4z7RsU4dhbqiMrP5IKO70z1OmhxEUJyreAQsmDllpNYlAY334UVCr-5T7_cvzf15RfP5LtA=&amp;originalReferer=&amp;sessionRedirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fkyma-project%2F) for the latest news.\n\nWe are looking forward to your feedback and engagement!\n","excerpt":"From the early stages of its development, Kyma has raised interest among other companies.

Why SAP? Kyma was donated to the open-source community a few months ago by [SAP](/blog/introducing-project-kyma). Stop by and find us at the SAP booth together with another great Kubernetes-native project called [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/).\n\nSo what are you waiting for?

A city perhaps... Cairo? Sounds good, right? \n\nIf you're wondering what does Cairo have to do with Kyma, we're happy to explain. We decided that new releases need a cool common identification theme. After a long, coffee-fuelled \nbrainstorming session we decided to name our releases after major cities in the world. Cool, right? \n\nSoooo... What can you expect from Kyma 0.6 Cairo? \n\n<!-- overview -->\n\nKnative integration is our main focus for this release. The new Knative Working Group ([click here to visit its Slack channel](https://kyma-community.slack.com/messages/CEC6R4T6U)) works tirelessly to make Knative components available in Kyma clusters. \nBy enabling a special toggle you will be able to delegate the eventing and messaging duties to Knative and use its ingress gateway for API exposure. \n\nThe [Prow Working Group](https://kyma-community.slack.com/messages/CD7GJ41QE) is also firing on all cylinders. Soon all contributors will be able to see the build status and the logs for their pull requests. What's even more exciting, Cairo will be built using the new CI architecture!\n\nWe're also working on a more consistent naming scheme for all of our components. As Kyma users are well familiar with Kubernetes Namespaces, we decided to abandon our custom term \"Environment\" and use the Kubernetes standard instead.  \nThe renaming will also affect the Application Connector, as we'll say goodbye to \"Remote Environments\" and start using the \"Application\" name instead. This is an important step that follows our [Application Connectivity vision](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/capabilities/application-connectivity.md). You can read more about both renaming efforts in [this](https://kyma-community.slack.com/archives/CD0K2NSQZ/p1544519219008800) Slack post. \n\nIn parallel, we are working continuously on the Kyma UI/UX - you can expect a better navigation structure and technical foundation for UI modularization and extensibility, achieved by switching Console UI to Luigi framework. \n\nWith the 0.6 release, we aim to improve code quality by introducing common libraries and unifying the acceptance tests code base. Additionally, the delivery of tools for testing the Service Catalog UI is planned.\n\nLast, but definitely not the least, we're continuously improving the security of Kyma. In the 0.6 release we're extending the UI-API Layer (GraphQL) with an authorization concept. \n\nYou can find all items planned for the 0.6 in [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/kyma---all-repositories-5b6d5985084045741e744dea/reports?report=release&release=5c015e1eda763f3a7c15abef). Come back and check out Kyma 0.6 Cairo when it's released on 14.01.2019 and keep an eye out for more Kyma news and updates on our blog. \n\nSee you around!\n","excerpt":"With winter holidays and 2019 around the corner, let's think about something hotter and more exotic.
