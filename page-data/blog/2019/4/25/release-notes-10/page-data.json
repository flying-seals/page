Extra! Read all about it! With the 1.0 Gliwice release, we have successfully reached our first big release milestone in Kyma. We realize that some of you might be confused and ask \"Why Gliwice?\" or \"Where even is that place?\" A quick [Wikipedia search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliwice) reveals that Gliwice is a Polish city situated in the southern part of the country, in the Upper Silesia. Founded in the 13th century, it has a rich history, a beautiful old town, and a river running right through its heart. From the software point of view, Gliwice is the home of the SAP Labs office which has most of the developers working on Kyma. Now that the naming conundrum is solved, let's dive into the details of our first production release.\n\n<!-- overview -->\n\nThe 1.0 release is all about security and stability. We invested a lot of time and energy in securing all communication in the Kyma cluster and finally we are able to turn on mutual TLS by default. This is something we promised to deliver in the previous release, but in the course of implementation we encountered more problems than we anticipated. Another important feature that we had to postpone and we're releasing with the 1.0 release is the integration with Grafana Loki. We didn't manage to implement it earlier because of several incompatible changes in log directories introduced in Kubernetes 1.14 but already applied in the Google Kubernetes Engine. See [this issue](https://github.com/grafana/loki/issues/393) for more details. These are the highlights of the Gliwice release. \n\nOur first production-ready version of Kyma will be released next week, around 25.04 and the first [release candidate](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1) is already out!\n\nKyma is a dynamic project and we don't want to slow down after giving you a proper production release. Just the opposite! We already started preparation for the next release. Have a look at the new and exciting stuff that's going to come in 1.1 Helsinki:\n\n- Addon Catalog - we will enable and promote a new way to share addons by combining the concepts of Service Catalog bundles with Helm charts. Add-ons can contain services, lambdas, and other Kubernetes objects along with the documentation and provisioning UI.\n- AWS Broker - We already have brokers for GCP and Azure services in Kyma. Adding AWS to the roster will make our service consumption offering more complete.\n- Asset Store configuration will utilize Google Cloud Storage.\n- Kiali integration - we will add the alpha version of this visualization tool for the Istio Service Mesh - it will require enabling a feature toggle.\n- Octopus - our new testing tool will replace Helm tests. Retries and parallel execution for tests will speed up Kyma development.\n- Performance tests infrastructure - we will track how code changes influence the throughput and latency of key components and we will tweak Kyma cluster configuration to give you settings suitable for the production environment.\n\nYou can find all the items planned for the 1.1 release in our [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/kyma---all-repositories-5b6d5985084045741e744dea/reports/release?release=5c5aae9ddcf5235c1876a4f2).\n\nKyma 1.1 Helsinki is scheduled for release on 13.05.2019, and 1.0 Gliwice is going to be available very soon. Keep an eye out for more Kyma news and updates on our blog. See you around! \n","excerpt":"Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

Still, we are proud to communicate a few new features we bring to you in 1.1 Helsinki. Read on to find out what has changed in Kyma since 1.0.\n\n<!-- overview -->\n\nThe highlights of Kyma 1.1 Helsinki include:\n\n- [Add-ons in the Catalog UI](#add-ons-in-the-catalog-ui) - We enabled a new way to share add-ons by combining the concepts of Service Catalog bundles with Helm charts.\n- [AWS Service Broker](#aws-service-broker-add-on) - We extended our third-party services by adding the AWS service offerings.\n- [Minio Gateway](#minio-gateway-mode) - We improved the Asset Store configuration to let you use Google Cloud Storage.\n- [Octopus](#octopus-in-kyma) - We introduced a new testing tool that replaced Helm tests.\n\nSee the overview of all changes in this release:\n\n- [Application Connector](#application-connector) - Application Operator optimization, OData support in documentation, new Event Service endpoint\n- [Console](#console) - Performance improvements, usability improvements\n- [Core and Supporting](#core-and-supporting) - Minio Gateway mode\n- [Documentation](#documentation) - Configuration and installation document improvements\n- [Eventing](#eventing) - Subscription CR status change, improved upgradability, new dashboards in Grafana\n- [Productivity](#productivity) - Octopus in Kyma\n- [Service Management](#service-management) - Add-ons in the Catalog UI, AWS Service Broker add-on, documentation support for add-ons, \"provision only once\" APIs and Events\n\nRead about a known issue for [Tracing](#known-issues).\n\n---\n\n## Application Connector\n\n### Application Operator optimization\n\nIn this release, we optimized the memory consumption for the Application Operator. The component is now much more stable and reliable, even under the high cluster load.\n\n### OData support in documentation\n\nYou can now read the updated Application Connector documentation that includes information on the supported APIs, including the support for [OData API registration](/docs/1.1/components/application-connector/#overview-overview-supported-apis).\n\n### New Event Service endpoint\n\nWe enriched the Event Service with the new `/{application}/v1/events/subscribed` endpoint that only returns information on the subscribed Events. This endpoint is perfect for your system optimization as the connected application no longer needs to send Events that are not used by any lambda or service. [Read more](/docs/1.1/components/application-connector/#api-event-service) about the endpoint and learn how you can use it to fetch Events.\n\n\n## Console\n\n### Performance improvements  \n\nAs a result of aggregating several calls into one, we reduced the initial loading time of the Console UI navigation.\n\n### Usability improvements\n\nWe added the `SYSTEM` badge to the system Namespaces. Thanks to it, you can easily distinguish them from the user-created ones on the Namespace overview page in the Console UI.\n\n![Namespace overview](./namespaces-overview.png)\n\n\n## Core and Supporting\n\n### Minio Gateway mode\n\nThe [Asset Store](/docs/1.1/components/asset-store) that ensures asset management in Kyma uses [Minio](https://min.io/) as a back-end solution. As stated in our documentation, we recommend that you use Minio in its Gateway mode for your production environment. This means you should use Minio as a gateway to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).\n\nIn this release, we focused on preparing an easy switch from the standalone mode to the Gateway mode by:\n- Making sure your data is seamlessly recreated after the switch.\n- Improving the stability of the Asset Store with Minio in the Gateway mode.\n- Providing clear documentation on how to [switch to GCS](/docs/1.1/components/asset-store/#tutorials-set-minio-to-the-google-cloud-storage-gateway-mode).\n- Integrating the Minio Gateway mode with our testing pipeline. This way, we can now test any new functionality against the Minio Gateway mode pointing to GCS.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Configuration and installation document improvements\n\nIn 1.1, we focused on creating configuration documents and simplifying the existing installation documents.\n\nConfiguration improvements:\n- An [overview](/docs/1.1/root/kyma/#configuration-overview) document explaining what you can configure in Kyma and how you can do it before and after installation\n- Improved documents on selected [component installation](/docs/1.1/root/kyma/#configuration-custom-component-installation) and chart values [overrides](/docs/1.1/root/kyma/#configuration-helm-overrides-for-kyma-installation)\n- A [template](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/guidelines/templates/resources/configuration.md) for the **Configuration** document type that provides technical details about configuration of a Kyma component's chart or sub-chart\n- A set of configuration documents for the [Asset Store](/docs/1.1/components/asset-store/#configuration-configuration) specifying the configurable parameters from the `values.yaml` charts and sub-charts that you can override. You can expect more of such documents for other Kyma components to come in the upcoming releases\n\nInstallation improvements:\n- A simplified [cluster installation](/docs/1.1/root/kyma/#installation-install-kyma-on-a-cluster) document explaining how you can quickly deploy Kyma on a cluster with a wildcard DNS provided by `xip.io`\n- A unified [local installation](/docs/1.1/root/kyma/#installation-install-kyma-locally) flow\n\n\n## Eventing\n\n### Subscription CR status change\n\nWe moved the status of a given resource from the `spec` section of the Subscription custom resource definition (CRD) to a sub-resource. This enables direct status interactions and recreating it without modifying the specification.\n\n### Improved upgradability\n\nWe added new tests for verifying the upgradability of Kyma Eventing. The tests ensure that a subscription created before an upgrade continues to work after the upgrade.\n\n### New dashboards in Grafana\n\nThere are two new dashboards available in Grafana:\n- **Ignored events** with Events for which there are no subscriptions\n- **Subscription details** to check if there are any issues with a given subscription\n\n> **CAUTION:** Currently, if the subscription name contains a dot (`.`), the dashboard charts will display the `NOT READY` status even if the subscription is `READY`.\n\n## Productivity\n\n### Octopus in Kyma\n\nAs part of productivity improvements in Kyma, we replaced Helm tests with the Octopus test runner. Kyma components now use Octopus as a testing framework to run tests defined as Docker images on a running cluster.\nRead more about [testing](/docs/1.1/root/kyma/#details-testing-kyma) in Kyma, [Octopus](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/octopus/blob/master/README.md) itself, and the benefits it brings to the Kyma testing process.\n\n\n## Service Management\n\n### Add-ons in the Catalog UI\n\nAiming to improve your user experience, we split the Catalog UI view into **Add-Ons** and **Services** tabs. This way, we separated the Helm Broker add-on configuration and installation inside the cluster from the third-party services. The Kyma cluster-wide integration UI also has a new **Add-ons Config** view where you can manage add-ons that are available in your Namespaced **Add-Ons** Catalog view. In the near future, we are also planning to rename bundles to add-ons.\n\n![Add-ons 1](./add-ons-1.png)\n\n![Add-ons 2](./add-ons-2.png)\n\n### AWS Service Broker add-on\n\nAs part of our constant efforts to improve your experience on third-party Service Brokers in Kyma, we extended our Service Catalog with Amazon offerings. The new [AWS Service Broker](/docs/1.1/components/service-catalog/#service-brokers-aws-service-broker) is available for you as an add-on, extending the existing GCP and Azure Service Brokers add-on family.\n\n### Documentation support for add-ons\n\nThe Helm Broker creates Service Class documentation from an add-on which appears in the **Add-Ons** Catalog UI view. [Read](https://kyma-project.io/docs/1.1/components/helm-broker#details-create-a-bundle-docs-directory) how to add documentation to your add-on. If your add-on extends the Service Catalog UI, [read](/docs/1.1/components/helm-broker#details-service-classes-documentation-provided-by-bundles) how to provide documentation for those new Service Classes.\n\n### \"Provision only once\" APIs and Events\n\nAPIs and Events of the Application Broker Service Classes now have a new \"provision only once\" feature that shows they are already available in a given Namespace.\n\n![Provision only once](./provision-only-once.png)\n\n\n## Tracing\n\n### Known issues\n\nBy default, the trace sampling rate for Istio is configured to 1%. With that rate, only a small ratio of all requests will be available in Jaeger for the trace analysis. We are planning to optimize that setting in next releases, including recommendations for specific usage scenarios.\nAs a workaround, adjust the setting manually using the official [Istio documentation](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/distributed-tracing/overview/) if you require a higher sampling rate.\n","excerpt":"After the long-awaited 1.0 Gliwice release, we focused mainly on putting the polishing touches to the current setup, including improvements in the Console UI performance and usability, Asset Store and Service Catalog extensions, Application Operator optimization, and documentation-related tweaks.
