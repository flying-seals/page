Wrong! We're continuing our travels through the summer holidays season and this time around we're headed to Kyoto. Let's have a look at the new features and improvements planned for the 1.4 release, shall we?   \n\n<!-- overview -->\n\nJapanese are known for their hard work and innovations they introduced to the world of technology over the years. With our newest release sharing its codename with the home of the tech giant that taught us that the princess is always in another castle, we were inspired to focus on innovation and vital improvements. \n\nOn the innovation front, you're getting an OAuth2 server integrated with Kyma. This solution is powered by [Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) and supported by [Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) from [Ory](https://www.ory.sh/). This feature-rich, lightweight (written in Go), and stable open-source solution backed by a huge community is a great fit for Kyma. We're going to make sure it's a good Kubernetes citizen and adds more value to our story and the \"batteries included\" principle we follow.  \n\nWhen it comes to improvements, Kyma 1.4 Kyoto aims to improve on the application registration process. We're going to achieve that by using Compass - a new subproject that is still in the [Kyma Incubator](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/). [Compass](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/compass) consists of components that provide a way to register, group and manage your applications across multiple Kyma runtimes. Using Compass, you can control and monitor your application landscape in one central place. In the new release, it will be available as an experimental feature activated through a feature toggle and will provide a preview of the API and the UI. \n\nRemember \"bundles\"? We decided to rename them to \"addons\" to better reflect the functionality they provide. Kyma 1.4 will come with more flexible addons, with a streamlined publishing process, hosting directly on GitHub, and the ability to enable them in selected Namespaces. \n\nHere are some other things you can expect to see in Kyma 1.4 Kyoto:\n- Improved Namespace view in the UI - better labeling, filtering, and visible health status of deployed workloads\n- Kiali upgraded to the latest stable version and with Single Sign-On enabled\n- Istio upgraded to 1.2.2\n- Backup procedure configurable as part of the installation process\n- Conversion Service and Validation Service for AsyncAPI specifications\n- Experimental standalone Kyma Function controller module with Knative implementation\n\nYou can find all the items planned for the 1.4 release in our [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/kyma---all-repositories-5b6d5985084045741e744dea/reports/release?release=5cd88a49145f41296ed5194a). If you want to get an even better look at our plans, be sure to check out the project [roadmap](https://kyma-project.io/roadmap/). \n\nKyma 1.4 Kyoto is scheduled for release on 8.08.2019. Keep an eye out for more Kyma news and updates on our blog. またね! \n","excerpt":"With summer in full swing and people enjoying their long-expected holidays, you might've thought that you're not going to get any news from us for some time now.

It also introduces the CloudEvents specification 0.3 for Event delivery and comes with even more useful documents that will guide you through the project. Read on to find out what Kyma 1.3 has to offer.\n\n<!-- overview -->\n\nSee the overview of all changes in this release:\n\n- [Application Connector](#application-connector) - Fetching API specification secured with Basic Auth or OAuth, automatic generation of the root Certificate Authority, additional headers and query parameters stored in a secured way\n- [Console](#console) - Less information noise in lambda logs, easy Namespace labeling and filtering, API list streamed using WebSockets, hide irrelevant navigation nodes, DevX improvements for the **Lambda** view, Console Backend observability improved\n- [Core and Supporting](#core-and-supporting) - Documentation component\n- [Service Management](#service-management) - Service Catalog migration from \"API Server\" to \"CRD only\"\n- [Kyma CLI](#kyma-cli) - Kyma CLI documentation, installation and uninstallation commands improved, Kyma certificate as part of the installation command\n- [Logging](#logging) - Loki updated to 0.1.0\n- [Documentation](#documentation) - Configuration documents, troubleshooting document type template, upgrade process documentation\n- [Eventing](#eventing) - Event delivery aligned with the CloudEvents specification 0.3, Kyma subscription cleanup\n- [Service Mesh](#service-mesh) - Disable authentication on selected API paths\n\n> **CAUTION:** Before you upgrade to Kyma 1.3, read the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/release-1.3/docs/migration-guides/1.2-1.3.md) which describes necessary manual actions required by the Application Connector.\n\n---\n\n## Application Connector\n\n### Fetching API specification secured with Basic Auth or OAuth\n\nApplication Connector supports a variety of authentication methods to allow users to register secured APIs. Now you can also register APIs with a specification URL that requires authentication as the Application Connector can use credentials to fetch the API specification. The supported authentication methods for fetching API specifications are Basic Auth and OAuth. Read [this](https://kyma-project.io/docs/1.3/components/application-connector/#tutorials-register-a-service) document to learn more.   \n\n### Automatic generation of the root Certificate Authority (CA)\n\nApplication Connector serves as a certificate authority that issues client certificates for external systems. Users can provide their own certificates and keys to be used as the root CA. In order to improve security and reduce configuration effort, we automated the certificate and key generation process. From now on, if the user doesn't provide a custom certificate-key pair, the certificate and key are generated automatically. Read [this](https://kyma-project.io/docs/1.3/components/application-connector/#details-application-connector-certificates) document for more information. To learn how the automated certificate generation affects the upgrade process and how to preserve your certificate and key, read the [migration guide](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/release-1.3/docs/migration-guides/1.2-1.3.md).\n\n### Additional headers and query parameters stored in a secured way\n\nApplication Connector allows you to enrich each request to the registered API with additional headers and query parameters. Now you can specify a custom list of headers and query parameters that contain sensitive information. The data is stored in a secure manner.\n\n\n## Console\n\n### Less information noise in lambda logs\n\nWe have significantly reduced the noise you have seen so far when inspecting logs from your lambda. By default, we hide health check logs, logs that originate from previous versions of your lambda function, and Istio sidecar logs. Additionally, we added an auto refresh option which automatically pulls new log lines into the UI.\n\n### Easy Namespace labeling and filtering\n\nNow you can manage Namespace labels easily in the Namespace **Details** view in the Console. This will help you better organize your Namespaces using label filter on the **Overview** page. Whenever you apply label filtering in the main Namespace **Overview**, the state of the filter is preserved so that you can stay focused on the Namespaces you have labeled.\n\n### API list streamed using WebSockets\n\nThe list of APIs contains up-to-date data with no need of refreshing the page. All changes in the APIs data are streamed live to the **API** view in the Console.  \n\n### Hide irrelevant navigation nodes\n\nIn case you find some navigation nodes in the Console irrelevant, you can simply ignore them by defining a list of specific navigation nodes or even whole categories that should not show up in the Console UI navigation. Read [this](https://kyma-project.io/docs/1.3/components/console/#configuration-console-chart) document to learn more.\n\n### DevX improvements for the Lambda view\n\nWe have fixed some usability issues that lambda developers were struggling with. Now, after saving changes to your lambda function, you are not redirected to the list of lambdas, but stay on the lambda **Details** view instead.\n\nWhat is more, the issue related to the [environment variables prefix](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues/3937) is fixed, which results in the same experience when you bind services to lambdas from the **Lambda** view and the **Service Instance** view.\n\n### Console Backend observability improved by integration with OpenTracing and Jaeger\n\nTo make sure that operations and troubleshooting of the Kyma cluster and its Console is easier, in this release we integrated the GraphQL-based backend service with OpenTracing. We also made sure that Jaeger gets proper data about GraphQL requests in a readable way. Now it is easy to check each request's length, failed parts, and logs.\n\n![Console backend](./console-backend.png)\n\n![Console backend 2](./console-backend2.png)\n\n## Core and Supporting\n\n### Documentation component\n\nIn this release, we've worked on a component for documentation that bundles a Markdown renderer and specification renderers, such as OpenAPI or AsyncAPI. The goal is to have a single reusable component that can be used in any context in the Kyma Console and on the `kyma-project.io` website. You can see the progress of this component in the [kyma-incubator](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/documentation-component) organization on GitHub. You can also see the preview of this component in action in the **Documentation** view of the Kyma Console. As you can see in the screenshot, with this component we introduce a right navigation bar for Markdown documentation. This new navigation contains not only a list of documents that you can see on the page, but also a scroll-spy that shows the reader's location on the website.\n\nOur next step is to officially release this component and use it in other Kyma Console areas, such as Service Catalog related views where you can see documentation for different services.  \n\n![Documentation component](./documentation-component.png)\n\n\n## Service Management\n\n### Service Catalog migration from \"API Server\" to \"CRD only\"\n\nNow you can configure Kyma to use the experimental \"CRD only\" mode of our Service Catalog. Read [this](https://kyma-project.io/docs/1.3/components/service-catalog/#details-experimental-features) document to learn how to activate this feature. Moreover, the new mode contains a migration tool that migrates data for you. To learn more about the migration process, read [this](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/service-catalog/blob/crds-migration/docs/migration-apiserver-to-crds.md) document.\n\n>**NOTE:** Before you start the migration, make sure that you performed a full [backup](https://kyma-project.io/docs/1.3/components/backup/) of your cluster. You should also test the procedure on a testing environment first.\n\n\n## Kyma CLI\n\n### Kyma CLI documentation\n\nWe have started documenting Kyma CLI commands, covering the `version` and `install` commands so far. We will continue to document other commands with future releases.\n\n### Installation and uninstallation commands improved\n\nWe improved the `kyma install` and `kyma uninstall` commands with better output in case of errors and timeouts.\n\n### Kyma certificate as part of the installation command\n\nAs part of the `kyma install` command, the certificate used by the installed Kyma cluster is installed to your local certificate trust store. This applies for Windows, Linux and MacOS.\n\n\n## Logging\n\n### Loki updated to 0.1.0\n\nLoki is now updated to the first beta version, which promises a much better stability and feature richness.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Configuration documents\n\nWe have successfully finished writing configuration documents for all Kyma components. If you want to check which parameters from `values.yaml` files of each component’s charts and sub-charts you can configure with overrides, check the **Configuration** section under a particular Kyma component.\n\n### Troubleshooting document type template\n\nIf you need to add troubleshooting documentation to your component, our content guidelines can help you with that. We have published a template for creating Troubleshooting documents. Find more details regarding the new document type [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/guidelines/templates/resources/troubleshooting.md).\n\n### Upgrade process documentation\n\nUpgrading Kyma to a new version is quick and really simple, and release 1.3 comes with documentation to back this claim. Follow the procedure described in the [Upgrade Kyma](https://kyma-project.io/docs/1.3/root/kyma/#installation-update-kyma) document to quickly migrate to a newer release.\n\n\n## Eventing\n\n### Event delivery aligned with the CloudEvents specification\n\nEvents delivered to the lambda or Serverless now have the context attributes propagated as HTTP headers. Those headers are aligned with the [CloudEvents specification 0.3](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/http-transport-binding.md#31-binary-content-mode). You can use a Cloud SDK in a language of your choice to write the logic of handling Event delivery. For example, [here](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go) you can find an SDK for Go.\n\n### Kyma subscription cleanup\n\nCertain properties which are no longer applicable after Knative migration have been removed.\n\n\n## Service Mesh\n\n### Disable authentication on selected API paths\n\nWith this release, it is possible to expose an API with authentication disabled on certain paths. It is useful for scenarios in which an API hosts public assets, such as schemas or login endpoints.\n\nTo allow disabling authentication on selected paths, there is a new **triggerRule** field in the Api CRD, which contains the `excludedPaths` object that represents the paths on which authentication should be disabled. The rest of the service's paths remain secured, meaning that the authentication is enabled. You can specify a matching method for paths using `exact`,`prefix`,`suffix` and `regex`. Read [this](https://kyma-project.io/docs/1.3/components/api-gateway/#custom-resource-custom-resource) document for more details.\n\n### Known issues\n\nA known issue related to Istio sidecar handling on AKS causes Kubernetes jobs with Istio Proxy sidecar to run endlessly as the sidecar doesn't terminate. As a workaround, disable Istio sidecar injection for all jobs on AKS by adding the `sidecar.istio.io/inject: \"false\"` annotation. To get a better understanding of this problem, read [this](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/15041) Istio issue and the related discussion. \n","excerpt":"After a short stop in Istanbul, we move forward to Jakarta with the brand new Kyma 1.3 release, which brings you a set of significant improvements in many components, including the Console and Kyma CLI.

We opened our repositories to the outside world and published the first version of our website. We introduced our project in a [blog post](https://kyma-project.io/blog/2018/7/24/introduction-project-kyma) and took first steps on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kymaproject), growing to over 700 followers.\n\n<iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=520 width=550 align=\"middle\"\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/kymaproject/status/1021830148948193280\"></iframe>\n\n## 26.07.2018 Kyma together with Knative launched at Google Cloud Next\n\nOpen source was a new land for us. When you make a step into the world of unknowns, better make it with a friend. Luckily, we were not the only ones that were at the beginning of the journey. We made an official launch at the Google Cloud Next event to be there together with the [Knative](https://github.com/knative) project.\n\n![google-next](./google-next.png)\n\n## 13.08.2018 Kyma made it to the CNCF Landscape\n\n<iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=430 width=550\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/kymaproject/status/1029029616684552192\"></iframe>\n\nOur [`kyma`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/) repository quickly reached 500 stars on GitHub. We also showed up on the [CNCF Landscape](https://github.com/cncf/landscape).\n\n![landscape-view](./landscape-screen.png)\n\nWe are definitely not planning to stop at 500 stars. This number was growing pretty slowly at first, but it has been increasing steadily since the 1.0 release. Remember that you can also star our project if you like it.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=kyma-project&repo=kyma&type=star&count=true&size=large\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"0\" width=\"158px\" height=\"30px\"></iframe>\n\n## 12.09.2018 First Core Special Interest Group meeting\n\nAfter creating an open governance model, we hosted our first public Core Special Interest Group meeting. It was hosted by our stars, [Piotr Kopczynski](https://twitter.com/PiotrasPk) and [Mateusz Szostok](https://twitter.com/m_szostok).\n\n`youtube: https://youtu.be/1DD5aCBnywQ`\n\nSo far, we have had 17 meetings and we are definitely not planning to stop organizing them. We meet regularly and you are welcome to join. Check more details at the [Core SIG landing page](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/collaboration/sig-core), join our next meeting, and let us know what you think about Kyma.\n\n## 10.10.2018 Kyma announced to SAP customers and partners\n\nKyma was announced to SAP customers and partners as the future of extensibility at the SAP CX Live event in Barcelona. [Alex Atzberger](https://twitter.com/aatzberger), president of SAP Customer Experience (SAP CX), talked about the important role Kyma plays for SAP.\n\n![kyma-sap-cx](./kyma-sap.png)\n\n[Moritz Zimmermann](https://twitter.com/moritzzimmerman), CTO of SAP CX, mentioned how Kyma shows SAP's commitment to openness.\n\n<iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=585 width=550\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/moritzzimmerman/status/1050427826221051905\"></iframe>\n\n## 10-13.12.2018 Kyma at KubeCon Seattle\n\nThanks to SAP sponsorship, we made it to KubeCon Seattle. Together with our brothers from the [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud) project, we could have a lot of valuable conversations at the SAP Open Source booth. We were represented by [Ahmed](https://twitter.com/Abd4llA), [Lukasz](https://twitter.com/derberq), and [Piotr](https://twitter.com/PiotrasPk).\n\n![seattle](./lysy-seattle.png)\n\nWe even made it to one of the presentations and were mentioned by friends from other departments.\n![kube-con-seattle](./kube-con-seattle.png)\n\n## 19.02.2019 First Kyma early adopters\n\nThe new year brought an important update to our [`http://kyma-project.io`](https://kyma-project.io/) landing page. We created a section where we could show off the early adopters of our project:\n\n![early-adopters](./early-adopters.png)\n\n## 25.04.2019 1.0 release\n\nYou can't even imagine how important this date was for us. We reached or first huge milestone and made it clear that Kyma is ready to be used on the production environment. So, what are you waiting for?\n\n<iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=720 width=550\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/kymaproject/status/1121426458243678209\"></iframe>\n\n## 02.05.2019 Netconomy went to production\n\nWe did not wait too long and a few days after the 1.0 release we got confirmation of the first production environment user. Our early adopter, [Netconomy](https://www.netconomy.net/), provided features to one of its clients and operates Kyma on its own. Netconomy will soon publish a guest blog post on the Kyma website describing their use cases.\n\n![netconomy-crew](./2019-05-02_kyma_golive_netconomy.jpg)\n\n## 07.05.2019 Kyma released with SAP C/4HANA Foundation to the production environment\n\nSAP, another early adopter that started using the Kyma project, made a big announcement of the production-ready offering for all SAP CX customers. The product is called SAP C/4HANA Foundation and you can read more about it in the [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introducing-sap-c4hana-foundation-thomas-hertz/) by [Thomas Hertz](https://twitter.com/primtom), Head of Technology at SAP CX.\n\n<iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=800 width=550\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/Abd4llA/status/1125857596789993473\"></iframe>\n\n\n## 21-23.05.2019 Kyma at KubeCon Barcelona\n\n<iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=550 width=550\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/derberq/status/1130832598954061824\"></iframe>\n\nYet another KubeCon event and we were there again. Thanks to the SAP support, we shared a booth with Gardener. This time the interest was much higher. Luckily, there were enough Kymians at the booth to answer all the questions asked.\n\n <iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=500 width=550\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/m_szostok/status/1131130333242568705\"></iframe>\n\n## 23.05.2019 We announced Kyma 1.0 on the Kubernetes blog\n\nWe wanted to make it clear to Kubernetes and CNCF communities that Kyma is out there with the 1.0 release that is ready for use on the production environment. We published an article on the [Kubernetes blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/05/23/kyma-extend-and-build-on-kubernetes-with-ease/) and it brought a lot of additional attention to our Kyma communication channels, website, and Twitter. We noticed we were becoming more recognizable. Some popular authors, such as [Infoq](https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/06/kyma-enterprise-kubernetes/), started to write about Kyma.\n\n## 18.06.2019 Kyma devs became Kubernetes contributors and Service Catalog approvers\n\nKyma core developers, [Mateusz Szostok](https://github.com/mszostok) and [Piotr Miskiewicz](https://github.com/piotrmiskiewicz), became official Kubernetes organization members and the approvers of changes in the Kubernetes Service Catalog. This way, we confirmed we do not only integrate and consume, but also contribute back. Currently, 2 out of 4 approvers of the Service Catalog come from the Kyma project - how cool is that?\n\n![kyma-kubernetes-contributors](./sig-member.png)\n\n## 02.07.2019 Kyma dev became a chair of the Service Catalog SIG\n\nKubernetes Service Catalog is one of our main dependencies. Kyma firmly states that [Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog) and [Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) are the only Service Management solutions for Kubernetes that bring the best developer experience. It is obvious that we are not only interested in contributing code, but we also want to help to run the project. As a result, [Mateusz Szostok](https://github.com/mszostok) became a chair of the [Kubernetes Service Catalog SIG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-service-catalog).\n\n![chair](./chair.png)\n\n\n## 03.07.2019 Setup of Knative dedicated team\n\nLast year, we open-sourced with our brother in arms, the [Knative](https://github.com/knative) project. Now, once we are stable and production-ready, let us make this brotherhood much more dedicated. We reorganized our setup a bit and created a team that will be dedicated to Knative contributions. We are planning to rebase Kyma on top of these contributions to improve our Event Bus and remove the dependency to Kubeless.\n\n\n# We are making another big step\n\nWe just keep walking, not planning to stop. Since day one, we have known that [CNCF Landscape](https://github.com/cncf/landscape) is not everything we want to achieve in CNCF. Our obvious next goal is [CNCF Sandbox](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/). This is not just our decision, though. The [CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)](https://github.com/cncf/toc) must sponsor the project's donation and this is our focus for the upcoming months. We need to identify what we must prepare on our side to become a part of CNCF. We also look forward to CNCF's feedback about Kyma.\n\n# We make friends\n\nWe understand how important it is to make friends in the open-source community. Leaving in isolation brings loneliness and we definitely do not want that for our project. Fortunately, we have a lot of visitors to our main [Slack  channel](http://slack.kyma-project.io). Apart from making friends among users, we also want to make friends among the projects we depend on, especially those that play or will play an important role in Kyma.\n\nA few of us regularly help the following communities:\n- [Ahmed Abdalla](https://twitter.com/Abd4llA) in [Knative](https://github.com/knative)\n- [Lukasz Gornicki](https://twitter.com/derberq) in [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.org/)\n- [Piotr Kopczynski](https://twitter.com/PiotrasPk) and [Mateusz Szostok](https://twitter.com/m_szostok) in [Kubernetes Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog)\n- [Piotr Mscichowski](https://github.com/piotrmsc) in [Ory](https://github.com/ory), [Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra), and [Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) projects.\n\n# We contribute back\n\nIf you depend on someone and you need more than you can get, don't wait until you get it, but help out and contribute instead! This is a list of projects where we made noticeable contributions that we are very proud of:\n\n- [AsyncAPI](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-react):\tThe entire component contribution and consultations regarding best practices for building an open-source community.\n- [Knative](https://github.com/knative/eventing):\tFeatures around NATS\n- [Kubernetes Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog):\tMissing features and improvements; official approvers and chairs\n- [Open Service Broker Azure](https://github.com/Azure/open-service-broker-azure):\tMissing features and improvements\n- [React JSON Schema](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form):\tMissing features and improvements\n- [Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio):\tMissing features\n- [Kubeless](https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless):\tMinor improvements\n\nThat was a hell of a year, and we can't wait to see what the upcoming year holds for us!\n\n# We want you to contribute - birthday gifts\n\nBirthdays are always connected with presents. This time we plan to give away some Kyma T-shirts, not for free though. You get those only if you become an external contributor in the next 7 days. Our understanding of an external contributor is that you are not a member of the Kyma organization on GitHub, and in the next 7 days you:\n- Contribute code or documentation to one of Kyma repositories. It must be a pull request but not necessarily merged. We can imagine that depending on the size of the contribution it might not be that easy to approve and merge your PR.\n- Contribute an issue using one of our templates. We equally value a well-described bug that is easy to replicate and an enhancement request with a well-described use case.\n\nAll Kyma repositories are located [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/).\nOnce you contribute, let us know about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kymaproject) or on the **#general** channel on [Slack](http://slack.kyma-project.io). We will evaluate all contributions on Thursday, August 1, and announce all accepted contributions and happy winners. Happy contributing!\n\nIf you don't know what to contribute, I'm sure we can help - just contact us through one of the above communication channels and we will point you in the right direction.\n\n![chair](./swag.png)\n\n# Join us\n\nIf you did not have a chance to contribute to our history, you can still join us and become a part of Kyma's future. We have many channels that you can use to interact with us:\n\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/kymaproject\n- Core SIG public meetings: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vWleTon7sJIk0teee4SoVezS4mR3K8TlkvXkgLJwRD8/\n- Slack: http://slack.kyma-project.io\n- GitHub issues: https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/kyma-project\n- Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kyma\n- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Q8bBtYe9gQN-dQ-_L8JvQ\n\nUse one of these communication channels to let us know what you think about Kyma and how you can start your contribution to the project.\n","excerpt":"Kyma is already 1 year old and we have a feeling it has only recently been open-sourced.
