On that very stage at Google Cloud Next 2018, both Knative and Kyma projects were announced and officially saw the light of day. Since then a lot of code was written and rewritten, shaping an extraordinary first year for both projects. You can go through some of the most memorable moments throughout [Kyma’s first year](https://kyma-project.io/blog/2019/7/24/happy-birthday-kyma/) or [Knative's first year](https://cloud.google.com/blog/) recaps.\n\n<!-- overview -->\n\n## Getting Kyma launched\n\nKyma started eight months before its public announcement, in an attempt to simplify software extensibility in the area of eCommerce at SAP Hybris. At that time, we knew neither that it was going to be open-sourced nor that the name would be Kyma. What inspired us to choose the open-source path was the initial interaction with several friendly partners. They all provided very similar feedback, were super enthusiastic, and asked for a way to get involved. At that point, we were convinced that we needed an open and highly collaborative model around the project. We first heard about Knative in the hallway track at KubeCon Europe 2018. Our first direct interaction with the Knative team took place already in early June 2018, when we exchanged ideas and discussed the direction going forward. On that day it became clear that our roads would cross again and that Kyma and Knative were destined to integrate well with each other.\n\n![Documentation component](./wheels.png)\n\nIt took us less than two months, with all the support we could get across SAP, to publish the project on GitHub under [github.com/kyma-project](https://github.com/kyma-project) – just in time for the initial launch at Cloud Next that took place exactly one year ago.\nWe received phenomenal feedback both during and after the launch event. We got many questions about the features, technology choices, roadmap, SLAs, and more. We had to address many of these issues on the go as we moved forward. We also got the (seemingly obvious) question where and when Kyma will get a marketplace on its own. \"Not so fast, not so fast,\" we were thinking, \"let's first learn to walk before we start running!\"\n\n## After the launch\n\nSince the launch, we’ve seen how the openness and flexibility of the Knative ecosystem have brought in many different vendors. Knative successfully simplified the experience of building apps on top of Kubernetes, enabling developers and operators to work together in the same environment. Some of the vendors around Knative provide interchangeable parts, such as [Gloo](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo) from solo.io and [Ambassador](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador) from Datawire that swap away and replace pieces of Istio. [Official stats](https://knative.teststats.cncf.io/d/5/companies-table?orgId=1) point at over 50 companies that have contributed to Knative.\nWe’ve also seen several projects kicking off on top of Knative, such as TriggerMesh and OpenWhisk. Kyma is also a part of this category, sitting steadily on top of Knative, enabling application developers to consume third-party services via the Open Service Broker catalog, and providing seamless connectivity to enterprise systems. We naturally started by integrating with our SAP apps. We became very quickly aware of the potential behind the approach in general, the reach it could provide to our partner ecosystem, and the large developer community out there. Leveraging Knative provides us with a flexible abstraction over the underlying Kubernetes resources. However, if one would want to go beyond Knative and work with Kubernetes directly at any point in time, that would be also possible. We went for this approach of radical transparency towards our underlying layers in Kyma.\n\n## Together with Knative\n\nWe started with a very clear and [ambitious plan](https://kyma-project.io/blog/2018/8/10/kyma-knative-progress-report) to closely integrate Kyma and Knative. At the launch, we were still using the Kubeless serverless stack underneath our functions’ runtime. At that time, we had a [plan](https://kyma-project.io/blog/2018/9/27/replacing-kubeless-with-knative) to replace it as soon as Knative Serving becomes more stable and reliable. By default, Knative included eventing implementation based on Kafka. While providing superb scalability, it had a resource consumption footprint which was going beyond what we planned. Therefore, we went forward with our NATS Streaming-based Knative eventing implementation. That went quite well, and it is nowadays part of the standard Knative eventing delivery. Since April, it has also been the default eventing layer inside Kyma. We use it in many projects ourselves, and we enable developers to benefit from the lower memory consumption it provides.\nAs it often goes, plans and reality do not always meet as intended. In March, we had to [temporarily suspend](https://kyma-project.io/blog/2019/3/27/wg-knative-closure/) our Knative integration plans due to other priorities within the project. We were quick to realize that sustainable progress requires a steady, disciplined, and long-term focus. To get there, we regrouped and have now established a dedicated Knative team, led by our own Ahmed Abdalla. The team will drive forward the closer Kyma and Knative integration, starting right away with Knative Serving.  \n\n## Going forward\n\nOur focus, as we go forward, is to work on two fronts. On the one hand, we have the core Kyma features, building a truly open frame that provides a flexible and easy way to connect and extend enterprise applications.\nOn the other hand, we look at our serverless foundational layer, where we see Knative with all its different components as a natural and logical choice.\n\nTherefore, we will work on:\n\n1.\tEstablishing Knative as a first-class citizen in Kyma.\n2.\tProviding a Knative-rich user experience within Kyma by leveraging the full landscape of Knative features, such as Serving, Eventing, Operator, CLI, and more.\n3.\tEnriching the Knative community with Kyma use cases, customer feedback, and challenges, which we can solve together in collaboration.\n\nSince we are still early in the journey, we have a lot of work ahead of us to reach our initial set of goals:\n1.\tReplace Kubeless serverless stack with the Knative Serving runtime.\n2.\tProvide production-ready and developer-focused user experience for eventing integration through the Broker/Trigger model.\n3.\tLeverage the full support of Event Sources within our Application Connector components.\n4.\tProvide easy out-of-the-box Knative installation experience through different Knative Operators.\n\nThis list could be much longer. By having a prioritized and focused working model, we are betting on the Knative community to be a partner in defining the future of enterprise software extensibility.\n\n## Fostering the community\n\nFrom day one, we planned for Kyma to be a vendor-neutral extension layer, making sure it meets our needs and the needs of the wider developer community. To stress that, attract new like-minded fellows, and reach a maximum audience, we’re currently planning the steps needed to donate Kyma to CNCF Sandbox, making sure to remove any barriers for potential contributors and collaborators. SAP has many years of experience in both writing and running mission-critical enterprise systems. It would be awesome to combine that with the different perspectives we will find out there with other vendors.\nOn the face-to-face front, we’ve taken extra care to cover some of the major events, such as KubeCon, OSCON, QCon, and several local Kubernetes-related meetups. Lately, we had the honor to host our friends from Google, [Matt Moore](https://twitter.com/mattomata) and [Scott Nichols](https://twitter.com/n3wscott), at a well-attended [Cloud-native meetup](https://events.sap.com/de/munich-knative/en/home) dedicated to Knative that took place in July in Munich. We conducted a poll there with the audience of over 70 people, and we jointly decided to launch the [Munich Knative Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Knative-Meetup-Group/). Stay tuned for more news on that and an announcement of the inaugural event in September.\n\n## In closing\n\nWe believe that wider collaboration creates the best environment for a vibrant and active community. We wouldn't be where we are today without all of your feedback and the early adopters who believed in Kyma and were open-minded enough to give it a try and not get discouraged by any hurdles on the way. You can find the [testimonial from XXXLutz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI4cOWO9HnA) as well as other early adopters on the Kyma and SAP CX YouTube channels. They all started throughout the year before we had our [openSAP course](https://open.sap.com/courses/kyma1) introducing Kyma and all the examples and automation around application integration. We’re deeply grateful for all the trust and support we’ve got so far!\n/#keepExtending\n","excerpt":"It was a warm and sunny July day in San Francisco (not kidding!) when we got into the crowded Moscone West conference center for a session entitled “Serverless on Google Cloud”.

We opened our repositories to the outside world and published the first version of our website. We introduced our project in a [blog post](https://kyma-project.io/blog/2018/7/24/introduction-project-kyma) and took first steps on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kymaproject), growing to over 700 followers.\n\n<iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=520 width=550 align=\"middle\"\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/kymaproject/status/1021830148948193280\"></iframe>\n\n## 26.07.2018 Kyma together with Knative launched at Google Cloud Next\n\nOpen source was a new land for us. When you make a step into the world of unknowns, better make it with a friend. Luckily, we were not the only ones that were at the beginning of the journey. We made an official launch at the Google Cloud Next event to be there together with the [Knative](https://github.com/knative) project.\n\n![google-next](./google-next.png)\n\n## 13.08.2018 Kyma made it to the CNCF Landscape\n\n<iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=430 width=550\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/kymaproject/status/1029029616684552192\"></iframe>\n\nOur [`kyma`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/) repository quickly reached 500 stars on GitHub. We also showed up on the [CNCF Landscape](https://github.com/cncf/landscape).\n\n![landscape-view](./landscape-screen.png)\n\nWe are definitely not planning to stop at 500 stars. This number was growing pretty slowly at first, but it has been increasing steadily since the 1.0 release. Remember that you can also star our project if you like it.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=kyma-project&repo=kyma&type=star&count=true&size=large\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"0\" width=\"158px\" height=\"30px\"></iframe>\n\n## 12.09.2018 First Core Special Interest Group meeting\n\nAfter creating an open governance model, we hosted our first public Core Special Interest Group meeting. It was hosted by our stars, [Piotr Kopczynski](https://twitter.com/PiotrasPk) and [Mateusz Szostok](https://twitter.com/m_szostok).\n\n`youtube: https://youtu.be/1DD5aCBnywQ`\n\nSo far, we have had 17 meetings and we are definitely not planning to stop organizing them. We meet regularly and you are welcome to join. Check more details at the [Core SIG landing page](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/collaboration/sig-core), join our next meeting, and let us know what you think about Kyma.\n\n## 10.10.2018 Kyma announced to SAP customers and partners\n\nKyma was announced to SAP customers and partners as the future of extensibility at the SAP CX Live event in Barcelona. [Alex Atzberger](https://twitter.com/aatzberger), president of SAP Customer Experience (SAP CX), talked about the important role Kyma plays for SAP.\n\n![kyma-sap-cx](./kyma-sap.png)\n\n[Moritz Zimmermann](https://twitter.com/moritzzimmerman), CTO of SAP CX, mentioned how Kyma shows SAP's commitment to openness.\n\n<iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=585 width=550\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/moritzzimmerman/status/1050427826221051905\"></iframe>\n\n## 10-13.12.2018 Kyma at KubeCon Seattle\n\nThanks to SAP sponsorship, we made it to KubeCon Seattle. Together with our brothers from the [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud) project, we could have a lot of valuable conversations at the SAP Open Source booth. We were represented by [Ahmed](https://twitter.com/Abd4llA), [Lukasz](https://twitter.com/derberq), and [Piotr](https://twitter.com/PiotrasPk).\n\n![seattle](./lysy-seattle.png)\n\nWe even made it to one of the presentations and were mentioned by friends from other departments.\n![kube-con-seattle](./kube-con-seattle.png)\n\n## 19.02.2019 First Kyma early adopters\n\nThe new year brought an important update to our [`http://kyma-project.io`](https://kyma-project.io/) landing page. We created a section where we could show off the early adopters of our project:\n\n![early-adopters](./early-adopters.png)\n\n## 25.04.2019 1.0 release\n\nYou can't even imagine how important this date was for us. We reached or first huge milestone and made it clear that Kyma is ready to be used on the production environment. So, what are you waiting for?\n\n<iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=720 width=550\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/kymaproject/status/1121426458243678209\"></iframe>\n\n## 02.05.2019 Netconomy went to production\n\nWe did not wait too long and a few days after the 1.0 release we got confirmation of the first production environment user. Our early adopter, [Netconomy](https://www.netconomy.net/), provided features to one of its clients and operates Kyma on its own. Netconomy will soon publish a guest blog post on the Kyma website describing their use cases.\n\n![netconomy-crew](./2019-05-02_kyma_golive_netconomy.jpg)\n\n## 07.05.2019 Kyma released with SAP C/4HANA Foundation to the production environment\n\nSAP, another early adopter that started using the Kyma project, made a big announcement of the production-ready offering for all SAP CX customers. The product is called SAP C/4HANA Foundation and you can read more about it in the [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introducing-sap-c4hana-foundation-thomas-hertz/) by [Thomas Hertz](https://twitter.com/primtom), Head of Technology at SAP CX.\n\n<iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=800 width=550\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/Abd4llA/status/1125857596789993473\"></iframe>\n\n\n## 21-23.05.2019 Kyma at KubeCon Barcelona\n\n<iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=550 width=550\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/derberq/status/1130832598954061824\"></iframe>\n\nYet another KubeCon event and we were there again. Thanks to the SAP support, we shared a booth with Gardener. This time the interest was much higher. Luckily, there were enough Kymians at the booth to answer all the questions asked.\n\n <iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=500 width=550\n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/m_szostok/status/1131130333242568705\"></iframe>\n\n## 23.05.2019 We announced Kyma 1.0 on the Kubernetes blog\n\nWe wanted to make it clear to Kubernetes and CNCF communities that Kyma is out there with the 1.0 release that is ready for use on the production environment. We published an article on the [Kubernetes blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/05/23/kyma-extend-and-build-on-kubernetes-with-ease/) and it brought a lot of additional attention to our Kyma communication channels, website, and Twitter. We noticed we were becoming more recognizable. Some popular authors, such as [Infoq](https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/06/kyma-enterprise-kubernetes/), started to write about Kyma.\n\n## 18.06.2019 Kyma devs became Kubernetes contributors and Service Catalog approvers\n\nKyma core developers, [Mateusz Szostok](https://github.com/mszostok) and [Piotr Miskiewicz](https://github.com/piotrmiskiewicz), became official Kubernetes organization members and the approvers of changes in the Kubernetes Service Catalog. This way, we confirmed we do not only integrate and consume, but also contribute back. Currently, 2 out of 4 approvers of the Service Catalog come from the Kyma project - how cool is that?\n\n![kyma-kubernetes-contributors](./sig-member.png)\n\n## 02.07.2019 Kyma dev became a chair of the Service Catalog SIG\n\nKubernetes Service Catalog is one of our main dependencies. Kyma firmly states that [Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog) and [Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) are the only Service Management solutions for Kubernetes that bring the best developer experience. It is obvious that we are not only interested in contributing code, but we also want to help to run the project. As a result, [Mateusz Szostok](https://github.com/mszostok) became a chair of the [Kubernetes Service Catalog SIG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-service-catalog).\n\n![chair](./chair.png)\n\n\n## 03.07.2019 Setup of Knative dedicated team\n\nLast year, we open-sourced with our brother in arms, the [Knative](https://github.com/knative) project. Now, once we are stable and production-ready, let us make this brotherhood much more dedicated. We reorganized our setup a bit and created a team that will be dedicated to Knative contributions. We are planning to rebase Kyma on top of these contributions to improve our Event Bus and remove the dependency to Kubeless.\n\n\n# We are making another big step\n\nWe just keep walking, not planning to stop. Since day one, we have known that [CNCF Landscape](https://github.com/cncf/landscape) is not everything we want to achieve in CNCF. Our obvious next goal is [CNCF Sandbox](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/). This is not just our decision, though. The [CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)](https://github.com/cncf/toc) must sponsor the project's donation and this is our focus for the upcoming months. We need to identify what we must prepare on our side to become a part of CNCF. We also look forward to CNCF's feedback about Kyma.\n\n# We make friends\n\nWe understand how important it is to make friends in the open-source community. Leaving in isolation brings loneliness and we definitely do not want that for our project. Fortunately, we have a lot of visitors to our main [Slack  channel](http://slack.kyma-project.io). Apart from making friends among users, we also want to make friends among the projects we depend on, especially those that play or will play an important role in Kyma.\n\nA few of us regularly help the following communities:\n- [Ahmed Abdalla](https://twitter.com/Abd4llA) in [Knative](https://github.com/knative)\n- [Lukasz Gornicki](https://twitter.com/derberq) in [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.org/)\n- [Piotr Kopczynski](https://twitter.com/PiotrasPk) and [Mateusz Szostok](https://twitter.com/m_szostok) in [Kubernetes Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog)\n- [Piotr Mscichowski](https://github.com/piotrmsc) in [Ory](https://github.com/ory), [Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra), and [Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) projects.\n\n# We contribute back\n\nIf you depend on someone and you need more than you can get, don't wait until you get it, but help out and contribute instead! This is a list of projects where we made noticeable contributions that we are very proud of:\n\n- [AsyncAPI](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-react):\tThe entire component contribution and consultations regarding best practices for building an open-source community.\n- [Knative](https://github.com/knative/eventing):\tFeatures around NATS\n- [Kubernetes Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog):\tMissing features and improvements; official approvers and chairs\n- [Open Service Broker Azure](https://github.com/Azure/open-service-broker-azure):\tMissing features and improvements\n- [React JSON Schema](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form):\tMissing features and improvements\n- [Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio):\tMissing features\n- [Kubeless](https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless):\tMinor improvements\n\nThat was a hell of a year, and we can't wait to see what the upcoming year holds for us!\n\n# We want you to contribute - birthday gifts\n\nBirthdays are always connected with presents. This time we plan to give away some Kyma T-shirts, not for free though. You get those only if you become an external contributor in the next 7 days. Our understanding of an external contributor is that you are not a member of the Kyma organization on GitHub, and in the next 7 days you:\n- Contribute code or documentation to one of Kyma repositories. It must be a pull request but not necessarily merged. We can imagine that depending on the size of the contribution it might not be that easy to approve and merge your PR.\n- Contribute an issue using one of our templates. We equally value a well-described bug that is easy to replicate and an enhancement request with a well-described use case.\n\nAll Kyma repositories are located [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/).\nOnce you contribute, let us know about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kymaproject) or on the **#general** channel on [Slack](http://slack.kyma-project.io). We will evaluate all contributions on Thursday, August 1, and announce all accepted contributions and happy winners. Happy contributing!\n\nIf you don't know what to contribute, I'm sure we can help - just contact us through one of the above communication channels and we will point you in the right direction.\n\n![chair](./swag.png)\n\n# Join us\n\nIf you did not have a chance to contribute to our history, you can still join us and become a part of Kyma's future.

Read on to find out how we're joining forces with Ory to bring an OAuth server to Kyma and contribute a completely new component to the lair of Hydra and its Oathkeeper. \n\n<!-- overview -->\n\nThe Kyma API Gateway enables exposing applications to the world outside of the cluster, at the same time allowing to secure access to the exposed application with JWT authentication. The implemented authentication mechanism allows to secure entire services or only selected resource paths within those services. You can read all about this in our [documentation](https://kyma-project.io/docs/components/api-gateway/). \n\nEnhancing security with authorization mechanisms has always been a part of the API Gateway vision in Kyma. Currently, basic authorization needs are fulfilled thanks to Istio and its implementation of [RBAC](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/authorization/istio.rbac.v1alpha1/) which allows controlling access to services in the cluster. Although you can apply authorization to the requests that the exposed services receive, there's no way to authorize the requested operation based on, for example, scopes. \nThis is a pretty significant gap in our security scheme, especially when you consider communication between 3rd party applications and the applications living in Kyma and exposed through the API Gateway. \n\nOne of the authorization strategies we are going to implement is through an OAuth2 server. Among many ready-to-use solutions available on the market, the one created by [Ory](https://ory.sh) caught our attention specifically. This solution comes with a full-fledged resource access authorization ecosystem, including an OAuth2 server and an OAuth reverse proxy. Additionally, this solution is a very popular, respected project with a high adoption rate and many stargazers on GitHub.\n\nTo investigate how the adoption of the Ory ecosystem would work with and potentially extend the Kyma API Gateway, we worked on a POC that used the Ory OAuth2 server - Hydra and the reverse proxy - Oathkeeper and focused on two OAuth flows: implicit grant and client credentials. The results were satisfactory and are documented in the form of examples available to inspect [here](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/examples/tree/master/ory-hydra/scenarios).\n\nBased on the positive results of the POC, we decided to focus our efforts on integrating Kyma with the Ory ecosystem. To facilitate this integration, we sat down with the developers from Ory during a workshop that helped to work out a plan of how to integrate our solutions and how the Kyma team will contribute to Ory's solution. \n\nSo how's the solution of Ory going to be used in Kyma? In the target setup, Kyma deployments will come with 3 Ory components: the Hydra OAuth2 server, the Oathkeeper reverse proxy that secures the exposed service, and the Oathkeeper Controller, which manages access rules for Oathkeeper. Kyma users will register their own OAuth clients in the Console UI and define access rules for their APIs. Thanks to that, every application will be able to get its own OAuth token and communicate with the exposed API. \n\n![Oauth2 flow in API Gateway](./oathkeeper-gateway.svg)\n\nThe role of the Kyma team in this setup is very clear - we are to create the Oathkeeper controller component and contribute it to Ory's ecosystem. \nAt the moment, the Oathkeeper is not designed to be used natively in Kubernetes as the configuration can be provided to this component only through an external server that provides the config, or directly through a file. Feeding the configuration to Oathkeeper in Kubernetes-native way using [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) is not supported. The Oathkeeper Controller is going to address this gap. Kubernetes users will be able to create custom resources that represent access rules for their services. The Controller will then pass this data to Oathkeeper in a format which it can work with without any additional modification.\n\n![Register access rule](./controller.svg)\n\nThis collaboration is going to bring great value to Kyma and Ory (Kyma supports OAuth2, Ory supports Kubernetes CRDs), and we're extremely excited that we're sailing the seas with the guys from Ory. Be sure to check out their solutions and follow our blog and releases to see how this adventure ends. \n","excerpt":"Working with others is always a great opportunity to learn and grow, so we simply couldn't say \"no\" to working with the team at Ory when such opportunity arose.
