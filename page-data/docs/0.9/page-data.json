Use the Service Catalog to provision new services in the\nKyma [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster and create bindings between the provisioned service and an application.\n\n\n## Service Mesh\n\nThe Service Mesh is an infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication, proxying, service discovery, traceability, and security independent of the code of the services. Kyma uses the [Istio](https://istio.io/) Service Mesh that is customized for the specific needs of the implementation.\n\n## Security\n\nKyma security enforces RBAC (Role Based Access Control) in the cluster. [Dex](https://github.com/coreos/dex) handles the identity management and identity provider integration. It allows you to integrate any [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) or SAML2-compliant identity provider with Kyma using [connectors](https://github.com/coreos/dex#connectors). Additionally, Dex provides a static user store which gives you more flexibility when managing access to your cluster.   \n\n## Helm Broker\n\nThe Helm Broker is a Service Broker which runs in the Kyma cluster and deploys Kubernetes native resources using [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) and Kyma bundles. A bundle is an abstraction layer over a Helm chart which allows you to represent it as a ClusterServiceClass in the Service Catalog. Use bundles to install the [GCP Broker](/docs/0.9/components/service-catalog#service-brokers-gcp-broker) and the [Azure Service Broker](/docs/0.9/components/service-catalog#service-brokers-azure-service-broker) in Kyma.\n\n## Application Connector\n\nThe Application Connector is a proprietary Kyma solution. This endpoint is the Kyma side of the connection between Kyma and the external solutions. The Application Connector allows you to register the APIs and the Event Catalog, which lists all of the available events, of the connected solution. Additionally, the Application Connector proxies the calls from Kyma to external APIs in a secure way.\n\n## Event Bus\n\nKyma Event Bus receives Events from external solutions and triggers the business logic created with lambda functions and services in Kyma. The Event Bus is based on the [NATS Streaming](https://nats.io/) open source messaging system for cloud-native applications.\n\n## Serverless\n\nThe Kyma Serverless component allows you to reduce the implementation and operation effort of an application to the absolute minimum. Kyma Serverless provides a platform to run lightweight functions in a cost-efficient and scalable way using JavaScript and Node.js. Kyma Serverless is built on the [Kubeless](http://kubeless.io/) framework, which allows you to deploy lambda functions,\nand uses the [NATS](https://nats.io/) messaging system that monitors business events and triggers functions accordingly.  \n\n## Monitoring\n\nKyma comes bundled with tools that give you the most accurate and up-to-date monitoring data. [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) open source monitoring and alerting toolkit provides this data, which is consumed by different add-ons, including [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for analytics and monitoring, and [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) for handling alerts.\n\n## Tracing\n\nThe tracing in Kyma uses the [Jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing) distributed tracing system. Use it to analyze performance by scrutinizing the path of the requests sent to and from your service. This information helps you optimize the latency and performance of your solution.\n\n## Logging\n\nLogging in Kyma uses [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki), a Prometheus-like log management system.\n","type":"Details"},{"order":"03-02-namespaces","title":"Namespaces","source":"\nA Namespace is a security and organizational unit which allows you to divide the cluster into smaller units to use for different purposes, such as development and testing.\n\nNamespaces available for users are marked with the `env: \"true\"` label. The Kyma UI only displays the Namespaces marked with the `env: \"true\"` label.\n\n\n## Default Kyma Namespaces\n\nKyma comes configured with default Namespaces dedicated for system-related purposes. The user cannot modify or remove any of these Namespaces.\n\n- `kyma-system` - This Namespace contains all of the Kyma Core components.\n- `kyma-integration` - This Namespace contains all of the Application Connector components responsible for the integration of Kyma and external solutions.\n- `kyma-installer` - This Namespace contains all of the Kyma Installer components, objects, and Secrets.\n- `istio-system` - This Namespace contains all of the Istio-related components.\n\n## Namespaces for users in Kyma\n\nKyma comes with three Namespaces ready for you to use.\n- `production`\n- `qa`\n- `stage`\n\n### Create a new Namespace for users\n\nCreate a Namespace and mark it with the `env: \"true\"` label to make it available for Kyma users. Use this command to do that in a single step:\n\n```\n$ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  name: my-namespace\n  labels:\n    env: \"true\"\nEOF\n```\n\nInitially, the system deploys two template roles: `kyma-reader-role` and `kyma-admin-role`. The controller finds the template roles by filtering the roles available in the `kyma-system` Namespace by the label `env: \"true\"`. The controller copies these roles into the newly created Namespace.\n","type":"Details"},{"order":"03-03-testing","title":"Testing Kyma","source":"\nFor testing, the Kyma components use the Helm test concept. Place your test under the `templates` directory as a Pod definition that specifies a container with a given command to run.\n\n## Add a new test\n\nThe system bases tests on the Helm broker concept with one modification: adding a Pod label. Before you create a test, see the official [Chart Tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/release-2.10/docs/chart_tests.md) documentation. Then, add the `\"helm-chart-test\": \"true\"` label to your Pod template.\n\nSee the following example of a test prepared for Dex:\n\n```\n# Chart tree\ndex\n├── Chart.yaml\n├── README.md\n├── templates\n│   ├── tests\n│   │   └── test-dex-connection.yaml\n│   ├── dex-deployment.yaml\n│   ├── dex-ingress.yaml\n│   ├── dex-rbac-role.yaml\n│   ├── dex-service.yaml\n│   ├── pre-install-dex-account.yaml\n│   ├── pre-install-dex-config-map.yaml\n│   └── pre-install-dex-secrets.yaml\n└── values.yaml\n```\n\nThe test adds a new **test-dex-connection.yaml** under the `templates/tests` directory.\nThis simple test calls the `Dex` endpoint with cURL, defined as follows:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: \"test-{{ template \"fullname\" . }}-connection-dex\"\n  annotations:\n    \"helm.sh/hook\": test-success\n  labels:\n      \"helm-chart-test\": \"true\" # ! Our customization\nspec:\n  hostNetwork: true\n  containers:\n  - name: \"test-{{ template \"fullname\" . }}-connection-dex\"\n    image: tutum/curl:alpine\n    command: [\"/usr/bin/curl\"]\n    args: [\n      \"--fail\",\n      \"http://dex-service.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:5556/.well-known/openid-configuration\"\n    ]\n  restartPolicy: Never\n```\n\n## Test execution\n\nAll tests created for charts under `/resources/core/` run automatically after starting Kyma.\nIf any of the tests fail, the system prints the Pod logs in the terminal, then deletes all the Pods.\n\n>**NOTE:** If you run Kyma locally, by default, the system does not take into account the test's exit code. As a result, the system does not terminate Kyma Docker container, and you can still access it.\nTo force a termination in case of failing tests, use `--exit-on-test-fail` flag when executing `run.sh` script.\n\nCI propagates the exit status of tests. If any test fails, the whole CI job fails as well.\n\nFollow the same guidelines to add a test which is not a part of any `core` component. However, for test execution, see the **Run a test manually** section in this document.\n\n### Run a test manually\n\nTo run a test manually, use the `testing.sh` script located in the `/installation/scripts/` directory which runs all tests defined for `core` releases.\nIf any of the tests fail, the system prints the Pod logs in the terminal, then deletes all the Pods.\n\nAnother option is to run a Helm test directly on your release.\n\n```bash\n$ helm test {your_release_name}\n```\n\nYou can also run your test on custom releases. If you do this, remember to always delete the Pods after a test ends.\n","type":"Details"},{"order":"03-04-charts","title":"Charts","source":"\nKyma uses Helm charts to deliver single components and extensions, as well as the core components. This document contains information about the chart-related technical concepts, dependency management to use with Helm charts, and chart examples.\n\n## Manage dependencies with Init Containers\n\nThe **ADR 003: Init Containers for dependency management** document declares the use of Init Containers as the primary dependency mechanism.\n\n[Init Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/) present a set of distinctive behaviors:\n\n* They always run to completion.\n* They start sequentially, only after the preceding Init Container completes successfully.\n  If any of the Init Containers fails, the Pod restarts. This is always true, unless the `restartPolicy` equals `never`.\n\n[Readiness Probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#container-probes) ensure that the essential containers are ready to handle requests before you expose them. At a minimum, probes are defined for every container accessible from outside of the Pod. It is recommended to pair the Init Containers with readiness probes to provide a basic dependency management solution.\n\n## Examples\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n1. Generic\n\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1beta2\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-deployment\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: nginx:1.7.9\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n        readinessProbe:\n          httpGet:\n            path: /healthz\n            port: 80\n          initialDelaySeconds: 30\n          timeoutSeconds: 1\n```\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: myapp-pod\nspec:\n  initContainers:\n  - name: init-myservice\n    image: busybox\n    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup nginx; do echo waiting for nginx; sleep 2; done;']\n  containers:\n  - name: myapp-container\n    image: busybox\n    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']\n```\n\n2.

These charts are installed as part of a single Helm release. To provide ordering for these core components, the Helm client runs with the `--wait` flag. As a result, Tiller waits for the readiness of all of the components, and then evaluates the readiness.\n\nFor `Deployments`, set the strategy to `RollingUpdate` and set the `MaxUnavailable` value to a number lower than the number of replicas. This setting is necessary, as readiness in Helm v2.10.0 is fulfilled if the number of replicas in ready state is not lower than the expected number of replicas:\n\n```\nReadyReplicas >= TotalReplicas - MaxUnavailable\n```\n\n## Chart installation details\n\nThe Tiller server performs the chart installation process. This is the order of operations that happen during the chart installation:\n\n* resolve values\n* recursively gather all templates with the corresponding values\n* sort all templates\n* render all templates\n* separate hooks and manifests from files into sorted lists\n* aggregate all valid manifests from all sub-charts into a single manifest file\n* execute PreInstall hooks\n* create a release using the ReleaseModule API and, if requested, wait for the actual readiness of the resources\n* execute PostInstall hooks\n\n## Notes\n\nAll notes are based on Helm v2.10.0 implementation and are subject to change in future releases.\n\n* Regardless of how complex a chart is, and regardless of the number of sub-charts it references or consists of, it's always evaluated as one. This means that each Helm release is compiled into a single Kubernetes manifest file when applied on API server.\n\n* Hooks are parsed in the same order as manifest files and returned as a single, global list for the entire chart. For each hook the weight is calculated as a part of this sort.\n\n* Manifests are sorted by `Kind`. You can find the list and the order of the resources on the Kubernetes [Tiller](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/v2.10.0/pkg/tiller/kind_sorter.go#L29) website.\n\n## Glossary\n\n* **resource** is any document in a chart recognized by Helm or Tiller. This includes manifests, hooks, and notes.\n* **template** is a valid Go template. Many of the resources are also Go templates.\n","type":"Details"},{"order":"03-05-deploy-private-registry","title":"Deploy with a private Docker registry","source":"\nDocker is a free tool to deploy applications and servers. To run an application on Kyma, provide the application binary file as a Docker image located in a Docker registry. Use the `DockerHub` public registry to upload your Docker images for free access to the public. Use a private Docker registry to ensure privacy, increased security, and better availability.\n\nThis document shows how to deploy a Docker image from your private Docker registry to the Kyma cluster.\n\n## Details\n\nThe deployment to Kyma from a private registry differs from the deployment from a public registry. You must provide Secrets accessible in Kyma, and referenced in the `.yaml` deployment file. This section describes how to deploy an image from a private Docker registry to Kyma. Follow the deployment steps:\n\n1. Create a Secret resource.\n2. Write your deployment file.\n3. Submit the file to the Kyma cluster.\n\n### Create a Secret for your private registry\n\nA Secret resource passes your Docker registry credentials to the Kyma cluster in an encrypted form. For more information on Secrets, refer to the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).\n\nTo create a Secret resource for your Docker registry, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nkubectl create secret docker-registry {secret-name} --docker-server={registry FQN} --docker-username={user-name} --docker-password={password} --docker-email={registry-email} --namespace={namespace}  \n```\n\nRefer to the following example:\n```bash\nkubectl create secret docker-registry docker-registry-secret --docker-server=myregistry:5000 --docker-username=root --docker-password=password --docker-email=example@github.com --namespace=production\n```\n\nThe Secret is associated with a specific Namespace. In the example, the Namespace is `production`. However, you can modify the Secret to point to any desired Namespace.\n\n### Write your deployment file\n\n1. Create the deployment file with the `.yml` extension and name it `deployment.yml`.\n\n2. Describe your deployment in the `.yml` file. Refer to the following example:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1beta2\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  namespace: production # {production/stage/qa}\n  name: my-deployment # Specify the deployment name.\n  annotations:\n    sidecar.istio.io/inject: true\nspec:\n  replicas: 3 # Specify your replica - how many instances you want from that deployment.\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: app-name # Specify the app label. It is optional but it is a good practice.\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: app-name # Specify app label. It is optional but it is a good practice.\n        version: v1 # Specify your version.\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: container-name # Specify a meaningful container name.\n        image: myregistry:5000/user-name/image-name:latest # Specify your image {registry FQN/your-username/your-space/image-name:image-version}.\n        ports:\n          - containerPort: 80 # Specify the port to your image.\n      imagePullSecrets:\n        - name: docker-registry-secret # Specify the same Secret name you generated in the previous step for this Namespace.\n        - name: example-secret-name # Specify your Namespace Secret, named `example-secret-name`.\n\n```\n3.

Trust it on the OS level for convenience.\n\nFollow these steps to \"always trust\" the Kyma certificate on MacOS:\n\n1. Change the working directory to `installation`:\n\n  ```\n  cd installation\n  ```\n\n2. Run this command:\n\n  ```\n  sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain certs/workspace/raw/server.crt\n  ```\n\n>**NOTE:** \"Always trusting\" the certificate does not work with Mozilla Firefox.\n\nTo access the Application Connector and connect an external solution to the local deployment of Kyma, you must add the certificate to the trusted certificate storage of your programming environment. Read [this](/docs/0.9/components/application-connector#details-access-the-application-connector-on-a-local-kyma-deployment) document to learn more.\n\n## Install Kyma\n\nYou can install Kyma either with all core subcomponents or only with the selected ones. This section describes how to install Kyma with all core subcomponents. Read [this](/docs/0.9/root/kyma#installation-custom-component-installation) document to learn how to install only the selected subcomponents.\n\n  > **CAUTION:** Running the installation script deletes any previously existing cluster from your Minikube.\n\n  > **NOTE:** Logging and Monitoring subcomponents are not included by default when you install Kyma on Minikube. You can install them using the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/master/resources).\n\nFollow these instructions to install Kyma from a release or from local sources:\n<div tabs>\n  <details>\n  <summary>\n  From a release\n  </summary>\n\n  1. Change the working directory to `installation`:\n      ```\n      cd installation\n      ```\n\n  2. Use the following command to run Kubernetes locally using Minikube:\n      ```\n      ./scripts/minikube.sh --domain \"kyma.local\" --vm-driver \"hyperkit\"\n      ```\n\n  3. Wait until the `kube-dns` Pod is ready. Run this script to setup Tiller:\n      ```\n      ./scripts/install-tiller.sh\n      ```\n\n  4. Go to [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases/) page and choose the latest release.\n\n  5. Export the release version as an environment variable. Run:\n      ```\n      export LATEST={KYMA_RELEASE_VERSION}\n      ```\n\n  6. Deploy the Kyma Installer in your cluster from the `$LATEST` release:\n      ```\n      kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases/download/$LATEST/kyma-installer-local.yaml\n      ```\n\n  7. Configure the Kyma installation using the local configuration file from the `$LATEST` release:\n      ```\n      wget -qO- https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases/download/$LATEST/kyma-config-local.yaml | sed \"s/minikubeIP: \\\"\\\"/minikubeIP: \\\"$(minikube ip)\\\"/g\" | kubectl apply -f -\n      ```\n\n  8. To trigger the installation process, label the `kyma-installation` custom resource:\n      ```\n      kubectl label installation/kyma-installation action=install\n      ```\n\n  9. By default, the Kyma installation is a background process, which allows you to perform other tasks in the terminal window. Nevertheless, you can track the progress of the installation by running this script:\n      ```\n      ./scripts/is-installed.sh\n      ```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\nFrom sources\n</summary>\n\nTo start the local installation from sources, run this command:\n\n```\n./installation/cmd/run.sh\n```\n\nThis script sets up default parameters, starts Minikube, builds the Kyma Installer, generates local configuration, creates the Installation custom resource, and sets up the Installer.\n\n> **NOTE:** See [this](#installation-local-installation-scripts-deep-dive) document for a detailed explanation of the `run.sh` script and the subscripts it triggers.\n\nYou can execute the `installation/cmd/run.sh` script with the following parameters:\n\n- `--password {YOUR_PASSWORD}` which allows you to set a password for the **admin@kyma.cx** user.\n- `--skip-minikube-start` which skips the execution of the `installation/scripts/minikube.sh` script.\n- `--vm-driver` which points to either `virtualbox` or `hyperkit`, depending on your operating system.\n  </details>\n</div>\n\nRead [this](#installation-reinstall-kyma) document to learn how to reinstall Kyma without deleting the cluster from Minikube.\nTo learn how to test Kyma, see [this](#details-testing-kyma) document.\n\n## Verify the deployment\n\nFollow the guidelines in the subsections to confirm that your Kubernetes API Server is up and running as expected.\n\n### Verify the installation status using the is-installed.sh script\n\nThe `is-installed.sh` script is designed to give you clear information about the Kyma installation. Run it at any point to get the current installation status, or to find out whether the installation is successful.\n\nIf the script indicates that the installation failed, try to install Kyma again by re-running the `run.sh` script.\n\nIf the installation fails in a reproducible manner, don't hesitate to create a [GitHub](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues) issue in the project or reach out to the [\"installation\" Slack channel](https://kyma-community.slack.com/messages/CD2HJ0E78) to get direct support from the community.\n\n### Access the Kyma console\n\nAccess your local Kyma instance through [this](https://console.kyma.local/) link.\n\n* Click **Login with Email** and sign in with the **admin@kyma.cx** email address. Use the password contained in the  `admin-user` Secret located in the `kyma-system` Namespace. To get the password, run:\n\n``` bash\nkubectl get secret admin-user -n kyma-system -o jsonpath=\"{.data.password}\" | base64 -D\n```\n\n* Click the **Namespaces** section and select a Namespace from the drop-down menu to explore Kyma further.\n\n\n## Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)\n\nBy default, the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is not enabled in your local Kyma installation, so you need to enable it manually.\n\nKyma uses the `autoscaling/v1` stable version, which supports only CPU autoscaling. Once enabled, HPA automatically scales the number of lambda function Pods based on the observed CPU utilization.\n\n>**NOTE:** The `autoscaling/v1` version does not support custom metrics. To use such metrics, you need the `autoscaling/v2beta1` version.\n\nFollow these steps to enable HPA:\n\n1. Enable the metrics server for resource metrics by running the following command:\n  ```\n  minikube addons enable metrics-server\n  ```\n\n2. Verify if the metrics server is active by checking the list of addons:\n  ```\n  minikube addons list\n  ```\n\n## Stop and restart Kyma without reinstalling\n\nUse the `minikube.sh` script to restart the Minikube cluster without reinstalling Kyma. Follow these steps to stop and restart your cluster:\n\n1. Stop the Minikube cluster with Kyma installed. Run:\n  ```\n  minikube stop\n  ```\n2. Restart the cluster without reinstalling Kyma. Run:\n  ```\n  ./scripts/minikube.sh --domain \"kyma.local\" --vm-driver \"hyperkit\"\n  ```\n\nThe script discovers that a Minikube cluster is initialized and asks if you want to delete it. Answering `no` causes the script to start the Minikube cluster and restarts all of the previously installed components. Even though this procedure takes some time, it is faster than a clean installation as you don't download all of the required Docker images.\n\nTo verify that the restart is successful, run this command and check if all Pods have the `RUNNING` status:\n\n```\nkubectl get pods --all-namespaces\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n1. If the Installer does not respond as expected, check the installation status using the `is-installed.sh` script with the `--verbose` flag added. Run:\n   ```\n   scripts/is-installed.sh --verbose\n   ```\n\n2. If the installation is successful but a component does not behave in an expected way, see if all deployed Pods are running. Run this command:\n   ```\n   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces\n   ```\n\n   The command retrieves all Pods from all Namespaces, the status of the Pods, and their instance numbers. Check if the STATUS column shows Running for all Pods. If any of the Pods that you require do not start successfully, perform the installation again.\n\n   If the problem persists, don't hesitate to create a [GitHub](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues) issue or reach out to the [\"installation\" Slack channel](https://kyma-community.slack.com/messages/CD2HJ0E78) to get direct support from the community.\n\n3. If you put your local running cluster into hibernation or use `minikube stop` and `minikube start` the date and time settings of Minikube get out of sync with the system date and time settings. As a result, the access token used to log in cannot be properly validated by Dex and you cannot log in to the console. To fix that, set the date and time used by your machine in Minikube. Run:\n   ```\n   minikube ssh -- docker run -i --rm --privileged --pid=host debian nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i date -u $(date -u +%m%d%H%M%Y)\n   ```\n","type":"Installation"},{"order":"04-03-cluster-installation","title":"Install Kyma on a cluster","source":"\nThis Installation guide shows developers how to quickly deploy Kyma on a cluster. Kyma is installed on a cluster using a proprietary installer based on a [Kubernetes operator](https://coreos.com/operators/). By default, Kyma is installed on a cluster with a wildcard DNS provided by [xip.io](http://xip.io). Alternatively, you can provide your own domain for the cluster.\n\nFollow these installation guides to install Kyma on a cluster depending on the supported cloud providers:\n<div tabs>\n  <details>\n  <summary>\n  GKE\n  </summary>\n\nThis Installation guide shows developers how to quickly deploy Kyma on a [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) (GKE) cluster.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (GCP) project with Kubernetes Engine API enabled\n- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) 1.12.0\n- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)\n- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account\n- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)\n- [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)\n- A domain for your GKE cluster (optional)\n\n>**TIP:** Get a free domain for your cluster using services like [freenom.com](https://www.freenom.com) or similar.\n\n## Prepare the GKE cluster\n\n1. Select a name for your cluster. Set the cluster name and the name of your GCP project as environment variables. Run:\n    ```\n    export CLUSTER_NAME={CLUSTER_NAME_YOU_WANT}\n    export PROJECT={YOUR_GCP_PROJECT}\n    ```\n\n2. Create a cluster in the `europe-west1` region. Run:\n    ```\n    gcloud container --project \"$PROJECT\" clusters \\\n    create \"$CLUSTER_NAME\" --zone \"europe-west1-b\" \\\n    --cluster-version \"1.12.5\" --machine-type \"n1-standard-4\" \\\n    --addons HorizontalPodAutoscaling,HttpLoadBalancing,KubernetesDashboard\n    ```\n\n3. Install Tiller on your GKE cluster. Run:\n\n    ```\n    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyma-project/kyma/{RELEASE_TAG}/installation/resources/tiller.yaml\n    ```\n\n4. Add your account as the cluster administrator:\n    ```\n    kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=$(gcloud config get-value account)\n    ```\n\n## DNS setup and TLS certificate generation (optional)\n\n>**NOTE:** Execute instructions from this section only if you want to use your own domain. Otherwise, proceed to **Prepare the installation configuration file** section.\n\n### Delegate the management of your domain to Google Cloud DNS\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Export the domain name, project name, and DNS zone name as environment variables. Run the commands listed below:\n\n    ```\n    export DOMAIN={YOUR_SUBDOMAIN}\n    export DNS_NAME={YOUR_DOMAIN}.\n    export PROJECT={YOUR_GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID}\n    export DNS_ZONE={YOUR_DNS_ZONE}\n    ```\n    Example:\n    ```\n    export DOMAIN=my.kyma-demo.ga\n    export DNS_NAME=kyma-demo.ga.\n    export PROJECT=kyma-demo-235208\n    export DNS_ZONE=myzone\n    ```\n\n2. Create a DNS-managed zone in your Google project. Run:\n\n    ```\n    gcloud dns --project=$PROJECT managed-zones create $DNS_ZONE --description= --dns-name=$DNS_NAME\n    ```\n\n    Alternatively, create it through the GCP UI. Navigate go to **Network Services** in the **Network** section, click **Cloud DNS** and select **Create Zone**.\n\n3. Delegate your domain to Google name servers.\n\n    - Get the list of the name servers from the zone details. This is a sample list:\n      ```\n      ns-cloud-b1.googledomains.com.\n      ns-cloud-b2.googledomains.com.\n      ns-cloud-b3.googledomains.com.\n      ns-cloud-b4.googledomains.com.\n      ```\n\n    - Set up your domain to use these name servers.\n\n4. Check if everything is set up correctly and your domain is managed by Google name servers. Run:\n    ```\n    host -t ns $DNS_NAME\n    ```\n    A successful response returns the list of the name servers you fetched from GCP.\n\n### Get the TLS certificate\n\n1. Create a folder for certificates. Run:\n    ```\n    mkdir letsencrypt\n    ```\n2. Create a new service account and assign it to the `dns.admin` role. Run these commands:\n    ```\n    gcloud iam service-accounts create dnsmanager --display-name \"dnsmanager\" --project \"$PROJECT\"\n    ```\n    ```\n    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \\\n        --member serviceAccount:dnsmanager@$PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/dns.admin\n    ```\n\n3. Generate an access key for this account in the `letsencrypt` folder. Run:\n    ```\n    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ./letsencrypt/key.json --iam-account dnsmanager@$PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n    ```\n4. Run the Certbot Docker image with the `letsencrypt` folder mounted. Certbot uses the key to apply DNS challenge for the certificate request and stores the TLS certificates in that folder. Run:\n    ```\n    docker run -it --name certbot --rm \\\n        -v \"$(pwd)/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt\" \\\n        certbot/dns-google \\\n        certonly \\\n        -m YOUR_EMAIL_HERE --agree-tos --no-eff-email \\\n        --dns-google \\\n        --dns-google-credentials /etc/letsencrypt/key.json \\\n        --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \\\n        -d \"*.$DOMAIN\"\n    ```\n\n5. Export the certificate and key as environment variables. Run these commands:\n\n    ```\n    export TLS_CERT=$(cat ./letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/fullchain.pem | base64 | sed 's/ /\\\\ /g')\n    export TLS_KEY=$(cat ./letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/privkey.pem | base64 | sed 's/ /\\\\ /g')\n    ```\n\n## Prepare the installation configuration file\n\n### Using the latest GitHub release\n\n>**NOTE:** You can use Kyma version 0.8 or higher.\n\n1. Go to [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases/) page and choose the latest release.\n\n2. Export the release version as an environment variable. Run:\n    ```\n    export LATEST={KYMA_RELEASE_VERSION}\n    ```\n\n3. Download the `kyma-config-cluster.yaml` and `kyma-installer-cluster.yaml` files from the latest release. Run:\n   ```\n   wget https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases/download/$LATEST/kyma-config-cluster.yaml\n   wget https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases/download/$LATEST/kyma-installer-cluster.yaml\n   ```\n\n4. Prepare the deployment file.\n\n    - Run this command if you use the `xip.io` default domain:\n    ```\n    cat kyma-installer-cluster.yaml <(echo -e \"\\n---\") kyma-config-cluster.yaml | sed -e \"s/__.*__//g\" > my-kyma.yaml\n    ```\n\n    - Run this command if you use your own domain:\n    ```\n    cat kyma-installer-cluster.yaml <(echo -e \"\\n---\") kyma-config-cluster.yaml | sed -e \"s/__DOMAIN__/$DOMAIN/g\" | sed -e \"s/__TLS_CERT__/$TLS_CERT/g\" | sed -e \"s/__TLS_KEY__/$TLS_KEY/g\" | sed -e \"s/__.*__//g\" > my-kyma.yaml\n    ```\n\n5. The output of this operation is the `my_kyma.yaml` file. Use it to deploy Kyma on your GKE cluster.\n\n\n### Using your own image\n\n1. Checkout [kyma-project](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma) and enter the root folder.\n\n2. Build an image that is based on the current Installer image and includes the current installation and resources charts. Run:\n\n    ```\n    docker build -t kyma-installer:latest -f tools/kyma-installer/kyma.Dockerfile .\n    ```\n\n3. Push the image to your Docker Hub:\n    ```\n    docker tag kyma-installer:latest {YOUR_DOCKER_LOGIN}/kyma-installer:latest\n    docker push {YOUR_DOCKER_LOGIN}/kyma-installer:latest\n    ```\n\n4. Prepare the deployment file:\n\n    - Run this command if you use the `xip.io` default domain:\n    ```\n    (cat installation/resources/installer.yaml ; echo \"---\" ; cat installation/resources/installer-config-cluster.yaml.tpl ; echo \"---\" ; cat installation/resources/installer-cr-cluster.yaml.tpl) | sed -e \"s/__.*__//g\" > my-kyma.yaml\n    ```\n\n    - Run this command if you use your own domain:\n    ```\n    (cat installation/resources/installer.yaml ; echo \"---\" ; cat installation/resources/installer-config-cluster.yaml.tpl ; echo \"---\" ; cat installation/resources/installer-cr-cluster.yaml.tpl) | sed -e \"s/__DOMAIN__/$DOMAIN/g\" |sed -e \"s/__TLS_CERT__/$TLS_CERT/g\" | sed -e \"s/__TLS_KEY__/$TLS_KEY/g\" | sed -e \"s/__.*__//g\" > my-kyma.yaml\n    ```\n\n5. The output of this operation is the `my_kyma.yaml` file. Modify it to fetch the proper image with the changes you made ([YOUR_DOCKER_LOGIN]/kyma-installer:latest). Use the modified file to deploy Kyma on your GKE cluster.\n\n## Deploy Kyma\n\n1. Configure kubectl to use your new cluster. Run:\n    ```\n    gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME --zone europe-west1-b --project $PROJECT\n    ```\n\n2. Deploy Kyma using the `my-kyma` custom configuration file you created. Run:\n    ```\n    kubectl apply -f my-kyma.yaml\n    ```\n\n3. Check if the Pods of Tiller and the Kyma Installer are running:\n    ```\n    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces\n    ```\n\n4. Start Kyma installation:\n    ```\n    kubectl label installation/kyma-installation action=install\n    ```\n\n5. To watch the installation progress, run:\n    ```\n    while true; do \\\n      kubectl -n default get installation/kyma-installation -o jsonpath=\"{'Status: '}{.status.state}{', description: '}{.status.description}\"; echo; \\\n      sleep 5; \\\n    done\n    ```\n    After the installation process is finished, the `Status: Installed, description: Kyma installed` message appears.\n    In case of an error, you can fetch the logs from the Installer by running:\n    ```\n    kubectl -n kyma-installer logs -l 'name=kyma-installer'\n    ```\n\n## Add the xip.io self-signed certificate to your OS trusted certificates\n\n>**NOTE:** Skip this section if you use your own domain.\n\nAfter the installation, add the custom Kyma [`xip.io`](http://xip.io/) self-signed certificate to the trusted certificates of your OS. For MacOS, run:\n  ```\n  tmpfile=$(mktemp /tmp/temp-cert.XXXXXX) \\\n  && kubectl get configmap  net-global-overrides -n kyma-installer -o jsonpath='{.data.global\\.ingress\\.tlsCrt}'  | base64 --decode > $tmpfile \\\n  && sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain $tmpfile \\\n  && rm $tmpfile\n  ```\n\n## Configure DNS for the cluster load balancer (optional)\n\n>**NOTE:** Execute instructions from this section only if you want to use your own domain.\n\n1. Export the domain of your cluster and DNS zone as environment variables. Run:\n    ```\n    export DOMAIN=$(kubectl get cm net-global-overrides -n kyma-installer -o jsonpath='{.data.global\\.ingress\\.domainName}')\n    export DNS_ZONE={YOUR_DNS_ZONE}\n    ```\n\n2. To add DNS entries, run these commands:\n    ```\n    export EXTERNAL_PUBLIC_IP=$(kubectl get service -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath=\"{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}\")\n\n    export APISERVER_PUBLIC_IP=$(kubectl get service -n kyma-system apiserver-proxy-ssl -o jsonpath=\"{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}\")\n\n    export REMOTE_ENV_IP=$(kubectl get service -n kyma-system application-connector-ingress-nginx-ingress-controller -o jsonpath=\"{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}\")\n\n    gcloud dns --project=$PROJECT record-sets transaction start --zone=$DNS_ZONE\n\n    gcloud dns --project=$PROJECT record-sets transaction add $EXTERNAL_PUBLIC_IP --name=\\*.$DOMAIN. --ttl=60 --type=A --zone=$DNS_ZONE\n\n    gcloud dns --project=$PROJECT record-sets transaction add $REMOTE_ENV_IP --name=\\gateway.$DOMAIN. --ttl=60 --type=A --zone=$DNS_ZONE\n\n    gcloud dns --project=$PROJECT record-sets transaction add $APISERVER_PUBLIC_IP --name=\\apiserver.$DOMAIN. --ttl=60 --type=A --zone=$DNS_ZONE\n\n    gcloud dns --project=$PROJECT record-sets transaction execute --zone=$DNS_ZONE\n    ```\n  </details>\n  <details>\n  <summary>\n  AKS\n  </summary>\n\nThis Installation guide shows developers how to quickly deploy Kyma on an [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/) (AKS) cluster.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)\n- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) 1.12\n- Tiller 2.10.0 or higher\n- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)\n- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account\n- [az](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)\n- A domain for your AKS cluster (optional)\n\n>**TIP:** Get a free domain for your cluster using services like [freenom.com](https://www.freenom.com) or similar.\n\n## Prepare the AKS cluster\n\nSet the following environment variables:\n1. Select a name for your cluster. Set the cluster name, the resource group and region as environment variables. Run:\n  ```\n  export RS_GROUP={YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}\n  export CLUSTER_NAME={YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME}\n  export REGION={YOUR_REGION} #westeurope\n  ```\n\n2. Create a resource group that will contain all your resources:\n   ```\n   az group create --name $RS_GROUP --location $REGION\n   ```\n\n3. Create an AKS cluster.

Otherwise, proceed to **Prepare the installation configuration file** section.\n\n### Delegate the management of your domain to Azure DNS\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Export the domain name, the sub-domain, and the resource group name as environment variables. Run these commands:\n\n    ```\n    export DNS_DOMAIN={YOUR_DOMAIN} # example.com\n    export SUB_DOMAIN={YOUR_SUBDOMAIN} # cluster (in this case the full name of your cluster is cluster.example.com)\n    export RS_GROUP={YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}\n    ```\n\n2. Create a DNS-managed zone in your Azure subscription. Run:\n\n    ```\n    az network dns zone create -g $RS_GROUP -n $DNS_DOMAIN\n    ```\n\n    Alternatively, create it through the Azure UI. In the **Networking** section, go to **All services**, click **DNS zones**, and select **Add**.\n\n3. Delegate your domain to Azure name servers.\n\n    - Get the list of the name servers from the zone details. This is a sample list:\n      ```\n      ns1-05.azure-dns.com.\n      ns2-05.azure-dns.net.\n      ns3-05.azure-dns.org.\n      ns4-05.azure-dns.info.\n      ```\n\n    - Set up your domain to use these name servers.\n\n4. Check if everything is set up correctly and your domain is managed by Azure name servers. Run:\n    ```\n    host -t ns $DNS_DOMAIN\n    ```\n    A successful response returns the list of the name servers you fetched from Azure.\n\n### Get the TLS certificate\n\n>**NOTE:** Azure DNS is not yet supported by Certbot so you must perform manual verification.\n\n1. Create a folder for certificates. Run:\n    ```\n    mkdir letsencrypt\n    ```\n2. Export your email address as an environment variable:\n    ```\n    export YOUR_EMAIL={YOUR_EMAIL}\n    ```\n3. To get the certificate, run the Certbot Docker image with the `letsencrypt` folder mounted. Certbot stores the TLS certificates in that folder.\n    ```\n    docker run -it --name certbot --rm \\\n        -v \"$(pwd)/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt\" \\\n        certbot/certbot \\\n        certonly \\\n        -m $YOUR_EMAIL --agree-tos --no-eff-email \\\n        --manual \\\n        --manual-public-ip-logging-ok \\\n        --preferred-challenges dns \\\n        --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \\\n        -d \"*.$SUB_DOMAIN.$DNS_DOMAIN\"\n    ```\n    You will see the following message:\n\n    ```\n    Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name\n    _acme-challenge.rc2-test.kyma.online with the following value:\n\n    # TXT_VALUE\n\n    Before continuing, verify the record is deployed.\n    ```\n    Copy the `TXT_VALUE`.\n\n3. Open a new terminal and export these environment variables:\n    ```\n    export DNS_DOMAIN={YOUR_DOMAIN} # example.com\n    export SUB_DOMAIN={YOUR_SUBDOMAIN} # cluster (in this case the full name of your cluster is cluster.example.com)\n    export RS_GROUP={YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}\n    ```\n\n4. Export the `TXT_VALUE`.\n\n    ```\n    export TXT_VALUE={YOUR_TXT_VALUE}\n    ```\n    To modify TXT record for your domain, run:\n    ```\n    az network dns record-set txt delete -n \"_acme-challenge.$SUB_DOMAIN\" -g $RS_GROUP -z $DNS_DOMAIN --yes\n    az network dns record-set txt create -n \"_acme-challenge.$SUB_DOMAIN\" -g $RS_GROUP -z $DNS_DOMAIN --ttl 60 > /dev/null\n    az network dns record-set txt add-record -n \"_acme-challenge.$SUB_DOMAIN\" -g $RS_GROUP -z $DNS_DOMAIN --value $TXT_VALUE\n    ```\n5. Go back to the first console, wait about 2 minutes and press enter.\n\n6. Export the certificate and key as environment variables. Run these commands:\n\n    ```\n    export TLS_CERT=$(cat ./letsencrypt/live/$SUB_DOMAIN.$DNS_DOMAIN/fullchain.pem | base64 | sed 's/ /\\\\ /g')\n    export TLS_KEY=$(cat ./letsencrypt/live/$SUB_DOMAIN.$DNS_DOMAIN/privkey.pem | base64 | sed 's/ /\\\\ /g')\n    ```\n\n## Prepare the installation configuration file\n\n### Using the latest GitHub release\n\n>**NOTE:** You can use Kyma version 0.8 or higher.\n\n1. Go to [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases/) page and choose the latest release.\n\n2. Export the release version as an environment variable. Run:\n    ```\n    export LATEST={KYMA_RELEASE_VERSION}\n    ```\n\n3. Download the `kyma-config-cluster.yaml` and `kyma-installer-cluster.yaml` files from the latest release. Run:\n   ```\n   wget https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases/download/$LATEST/kyma-config-cluster.yaml\n   wget https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases/download/$LATEST/kyma-installer-cluster.yaml\n   ```\n\n4. Prepare the deployment file.\n\n    - Run this command if you use the `xip.io` default domain:\n    ```\n    cat kyma-installer-cluster.yaml <(echo -e \"\\n---\") kyma-config-cluster.yaml | sed -e \"s/__PROXY_EXCLUDE_IP_RANGES__/10.0.0.1/g\" | sed -e \"s/__.*__//g\" > my-kyma.yaml\n    ```\n\n    - Run this command if you use your own domain:\n    ```\n    cat kyma-installer-cluster.yaml <(echo -e \"\\n---\") kyma-config-cluster.yaml | sed -e \"s/__PROXY_EXCLUDE_IP_RANGES__/10.0.0.1/g\" | sed -e \"s/__DOMAIN__/$SUB_DOMAIN.$DNS_DOMAIN/g\" | sed -e \"s/__TLS_CERT__/$TLS_CERT/g\" | sed -e \"s/__TLS_KEY__/$TLS_KEY/g\" | sed -e \"s/__.*__//g\" > my-kyma.yaml\n    ```\n\n5. The output of this operation is the `my_kyma.yaml` file. Use it to deploy Kyma on your GKE cluster.\n\n\n### Using your own image\n\n1. Checkout [kyma-project](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma) and enter the root folder.\n\n2. Build an image that is based on the current Installer image and includes the current installation and resources charts. Run:\n\n    ```\n    docker build -t kyma-installer:latest -f tools/kyma-installer/kyma.Dockerfile .\n    ```\n\n3. Push the image to your Docker Hub:\n    ```\n    docker tag kyma-installer:latest {YOUR_DOCKER_LOGIN}/kyma-installer:latest\n    docker push {YOUR_DOCKER_LOGIN}/kyma-installer:latest\n    ```\n\n4. Prepare the deployment file:\n\n    - Run this command if you use the `xip.io` default domain:\n    ```\n    (cat installation/resources/installer.yaml ; echo \"\\n---\" ; cat installation/resources/installer-config-cluster.yaml.tpl ; echo \"\\n---\" ; cat installation/resources/installer-cr-cluster.yaml.tpl) | sed -e \"s/__PROXY_EXCLUDE_IP_RANGES__/10.0.0.1/g\" | sed -e \"s/__.*__//g\" > my-kyma.yaml\n    ```\n\n    - Run this command if you use your own domain:\n    ```\n    (cat installation/resources/installer.yaml ; echo \"\\n---\" ; cat installation/resources/installer-config-cluster.yaml.tpl ; echo \"\\n---\" ; cat installation/resources/installer-cr-cluster.yaml.tpl) | sed -e \"s/__PROXY_EXCLUDE_IP_RANGES__/10.0.0.1/g\" | sed -e \"s/__DOMAIN__/$SUB_DOMAIN.$DNS_DOMAIN/g\" | sed -e \"s/__TLS_CERT__/$TLS_CERT/g\" | sed -e \"s/__TLS_KEY__/$TLS_KEY/g\" | sed -e \"s/__.*__//g\" > my-kyma.yaml\n    ```\n\n5. The output of this operation is the `my_kyma.yaml` file. Modify it to fetch the proper image with the changes you made ([YOUR_DOCKER_LOGIN]/kyma-installer:latest). Use the modified file to deploy Kyma on your GKE cluster.\n\n## Deploy Kyma\n\n1. Deploy Kyma using the `my-kyma` custom configuration file you created. Run:\n    ```\n    kubectl apply -f my-kyma.yaml\n    ```\n    >**NOTE:** If you get the `Error from server (MethodNotAllowed)` error, run the command again before proceeding to the next step.\n\n2. Check if the Pods of Tiller and the Kyma Installer are running:\n    ```\n    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces\n    ```\n\n3. Start Kyma installation:\n    ```\n    kubectl label installation/kyma-installation action=install\n    ```\n\n4. To watch the installation progress, run:\n    ```\n    while true; do \\\n      kubectl -n default get installation/kyma-installation -o jsonpath=\"{'Status: '}{.status.state}{', description: '}{.status.description}\"; echo; \\\n      sleep 5; \\\n    done\n    ```\n    After the installation process is finished, the `Status: Installed, description: Kyma installed` message appears.\n    In case of an error, you can fetch the logs from the Installer by running:\n    ```\n    kubectl -n kyma-installer logs -l 'name=kyma-installer'\n    ```\n\n## Add the xip.io self-signed certificate to your OS trusted certificates\n\n>**NOTE:** Skip this section if you use your own domain.\n\nAfter the installation, add the custom Kyma [`xip.io`](http://xip.io/) self-signed certificate to the trusted certificates of your OS. For MacOS, run:\n```\ntmpfile=$(mktemp /tmp/temp-cert.XXXXXX) \\\n&& kubectl get configmap cluster-certificate-overrides -n kyma-installer -o jsonpath='{.data.global\\.tlsCrt}' | base64 --decode > $tmpfile \\\n&& sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain $tmpfile \\\n&& rm $tmpfile\n```\n\n## Configure DNS for the cluster load balancer (optional)\n\n>**NOTE:** Execute instructions from this section only if you want to use your own domain.\n\nRun these commands:\n\n```\nexport EXTERNAL_PUBLIC_IP=$(kubectl get service -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath=\"{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}\")\n\nexport REMOTE_ENV_IP=$(kubectl get service -n kyma-system application-connector-ingress-nginx-ingress-controller -o jsonpath=\"{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}\")\n\nexport APISERVER_PUBLIC_IP=$(kubectl get service -n kyma-system apiserver-proxy-ssl -o jsonpath=\"{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}\")\n\naz network dns record-set a create -g $RS_GROUP -z $DNS_DOMAIN -n \\*.$SUB_DOMAIN --ttl 60\naz network dns record-set a add-record -g $RS_GROUP -z $DNS_DOMAIN -n \\*.$SUB_DOMAIN -a $EXTERNAL_PUBLIC_IP\n\naz network dns record-set a create -g $RS_GROUP -z $DNS_DOMAIN -n gateway.$SUB_DOMAIN --ttl 60\naz network dns record-set a add-record -g $RS_GROUP -z $DNS_DOMAIN -n gateway.$SUB_DOMAIN -a $REMOTE_ENV_IP\n\naz network dns record-set a create -g $RS_GROUP -z $DNS_DOMAIN -n apiserver.$SUB_DOMAIN --ttl 60\naz network dns record-set a add-record -g $RS_GROUP -z $DNS_DOMAIN -n apiserver.$SUB_DOMAIN -a $APISERVER_PUBLIC_IP\n```\n  </details>\n</div>\n\n## Access Tiller (optional)\n\nIf you need to use Helm, you must establish a secure connection with Tiller by saving the cluster's client certificate, key, and Certificate Authority (CA) to [Helm Home](https://helm.sh/docs/glossary/#helm-home-helm-home). \n\nAdditionally, you must add the `--tls` flag to every Helm command you run.\n\n>**NOTE:** Read [this](#details-tls-in-tiller) document to learn more about TLS in Tiller.\n\nRun these commands to save the client certificate, key, and CA to [Helm Home](https://helm.sh/docs/glossary/#helm-home-helm-home):\n\n```bash\nkubectl get -n kyma-installer secret helm-secret -o jsonpath=\"{.data['global\\.helm\\.ca\\.crt']}\" | base64 --decode > \"$(helm home)/ca.pem\";\nkubectl get -n kyma-installer secret helm-secret -o jsonpath=\"{.data['global\\.helm\\.tls\\.crt']}\" | base64 --decode > \"$(helm home)/cert.pem\";\nkubectl get -n kyma-installer secret helm-secret -o jsonpath=\"{.data['global\\.helm\\.tls\\.key']}\" | base64 --decode > \"$(helm home)/key.pem\";\n```\n\n## Access the cluster\n\n1. To get the address of the cluster's Console, check the name of the Console's virtual service. The name of this virtual service corresponds to the Console URL. To get the virtual service name, run:\n\n```\nkubectl get virtualservice core-console -n kyma-system\n```\n\n2. Access your cluster under this address:\n\n```\nhttps://{VIRTUAL_SERVICE_NAME}\n```\n\n>**NOTE:** To log in to your cluster, use the default `admin` static user. To learn how to get the login details for this user, see [this](#installation-install-kyma-locally-access-the-kyma-console) document.\n","type":"Installation"},{"order":"04-08-custom-component-installation","title":"Custom component installation","source":"\nSince Kyma is modular, you can remove some components so that they are not installed together with Kyma. You can also add some of them after the installation process. Read this document to learn how to do that.\n\n## Remove a component\n\n>**NOTE:** Not all components can be simply removed from the Kyma installation. In case of Istio and the Service Catalog, you must provide your own deployment of these components in the Kyma-supported version before you remove them from the installation process. See [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/resources/istio-kyma-patch/templates/job.yaml#L25) file to check the currently supported version of Istio. See [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/resources/service-catalog/charts/catalog/values.yaml#L3) file to check the currently supported version of the Service Catalog.\n\nTo disable a component from the list of components that you install with Kyma, remove this component's entries from the appropriate file. The file differs depending on whether you install Kyma from the release or from sources, and if you install Kyma locally or on a cluster. The version of your component's deployment must match the version that Kyma currently supports.\n\n### Installation from the release\n\n1. Download the [newest version](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases) of Kyma.\n2. Customize installation by removing a component from the list of components in the Installation resource. For example, to disable the Application Connector installation, remove this entry:\n    ```\n    name: \"application-connector\"\n    namespace: \"kyma-system\"\n    ```\n  * from the `kyma-config-local.yaml` file for the **local** installation\n  * from the `kyma-config-cluster.yaml` file for the **cluster** installation\n\n\n3. Follow the installation steps described in the [Install Kyma locally from the release](#installation-install-kyma-locally-from-the-release) document, or [Install Kyma on a GKE cluster](#installation-install-kyma-on-a-gke-cluster) accordingly.\n\n### Installation from sources\n\n1. Customize installation by removing a component from the list of components in the following Installation resource:\n  * [installer-cr.yaml.tpl](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/installation/resources/installer-cr.yaml.tpl) for the **local** installation\n  *  [installer-cr-cluster.yaml.tpl](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/installation/resources/installer-cr-cluster.yaml.tpl) for the **cluster** installation\n\n2. Follow the installation steps described in the [Install Kyma locally from sources](#installation-install-kyma-locally-from-sources) document, or [Install Kyma on a GKE cluster](#installation-install-kyma-on-a-gke-cluster) accordingly.\n\n### Verify the installation\n\n1. Check if all Pods are running in the `kyma-system` Namespace:\n  ```\n  kubectl get pods -n kyma-system\n  ```\n2. Sign in to the Kyma Console using the `admin@kyma.cx` email address as described in the [Install Kyma locally from the release](#installation-install-kyma-locally-from-the-release) document.\n\n\n## Add a component\n\n>**NOTE:** This section assumes that you already have your Kyma Lite local version installed successfully.\n\nTo install a component that is not installed with Kyma by default, modify the [Installation](#custom-resource-installation) custom resource and add the component that you want to install to the list of components :\n\n1. Edit the resource:\n    ```\n    kubectl edit installation kyma-installation\n    ```\n2. Add the new component to the list of components, for example:\n    ```\n    - name: \"jaeger\"\n      namespace: \"kyma-system\"\n    ```\n3. Trigger the installation:\n   ```\n   kubectl label installation/kyma-installation action=install\n   ```\n\nYou can verify the installation status by calling `./installation/scripts/is-installed.sh` in the terminal.\n","type":"Installation"},{"order":"04-10-update","title":"Update Kyma","source":"\nThis guide describes how to update Kyma deployed locally or on a cluster.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)\n- Access to a Docker Registry - only for cluster installation\n\n## Overview\n\nKyma consists of multiple components, installed as [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/tree/master/docs) releases.\n\nUpdate of an existing deployment can include:\n- changes in charts\n- changes in overrides\n- adding new releases\n\nThe update procedure consists of three main steps:\n- Prepare the update\n- Update the Kyma Installer\n- Trigger the update process\n\n> **NOTE:** In case of dependency conflicts or major changes between components versions, some updates may not be possible.\n\n> **NOTE:** Currently Kyma doesn't support removing components as a part of the update process.\n\n\n## Prepare the update\n\n- If you update an existing component, make all required changes to the Helm charts of the component located in the [`resource`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/master/resources) directory.\n\n- If you add a new component to your Kyma deployment, add a top-level Helm chart for that component. Additionally, run this command to edit the Installation custom resource and add the new component to the installed components list:\n  ```\n  kubectl edit installation kyma-installation\n  ```\n\n  > **NOTE:** Read [this](#custom-resource-installation) document to learn more about the Installation custom resource.\n\n\n- If you introduced changes in overrides, update the existing ConfigMaps and Secrets. Add new ConfigMaps and Secrets if required. See [this](#getting-started-helm-overrides-for-kyma-installation) document for more information on overrides.\n\n\n## Update the Kyma Installer on a local deployment\n\n- Build a new image for the Kyma Installer:  \n  ```\n  ./installation/scripts/build-kyma-installer.sh\n  ```  \n  > **NOTE:** If you started Kyma with the `run.sh` script with a `--vm-driver {value}` parameter, provide the same parameter to the `build-kyma-installer.sh` script.\n\n- Restart the Kyma Installer Pod:  \n  ```\n  kubectl delete pod -n kyma-installer {INSTALLER_POD_NAME}\n  ```\n\n## Update the Kyma Installer on a cluster deployment\n\n- Build a new image for the Kyma Installer:\n  ```\n  docker build -t {IMAGE_NAME}:{IMAGE_TAG} -f tools/kyma-installer/kyma.Dockerfile .\n  ```\n\n- Push the image to your Docker registry.\n\n- Redeploy the Kyma Installer Pod using the new image.

Kyma does not work on a basic Minikube cluster that you can start using the `minikube start` command.\n\nThe purpose of the `installation/scripts/minikube.sh` script is to configure and start Minikube. The script also checks if your development environment is configured to handle the Kyma installation. This includes checking Minikube and kubectl versions.\n\nIf Minikube is already initialized, the system prompts you to agree to remove the previous Minikube cluster.\n- If you plan to perform a clean installation, answer `yes`.\n- If you installed Kyma to your Minikube cluster and then stopped the cluster using the `minikube stop` command, answer `no`.  This allows you to start the cluster again without reinstalling Kyma.\n\nMinikube is configured to disable the default Nginx Ingress Controller.\n\n>**NOTE:** For the complete list of parameters passed to the `minikube start` command, refer to the `installation/scripts/minikube.sh` script.\n\nOnce Minikube is up and running, the script adds local installation entries to `/etc/hosts`.\n\n## The build-kyma-installer.sh script\n\nThe Kyma Installer is an application based on the [Kubernetes operator](https://coreos.com/operators/). Its purpose is to install Helm charts defined in the Installation custom resource. The Kyma Installer is a Docker image that bundles the Installer binary with Kyma charts.\n\nThe `installation/scripts/build-kyma-installer.sh` script extracts the Kyma-Installer image name from the `installer.yaml` deployment file and uses it to build a Docker image inside Minikube. This image contains local Kyma sources from the `resources` folder.\n\n>**NOTE:** For the Kyma Installer Docker image details, refer to the `tools/kyma-installer/kyma.Dockerfile` file.\n\n## The create-cr.sh script\n\nThe `installation/scripts/create-cr.sh` script prepares the Installation custom resource from the `installation/resources/installer-cr.yaml.tpl` template. The local installation scenario uses the default Installation custom resource. The Kyma Installer already contains local Kyma resources bundled, thus `url` is ignored by the Installer component.\n\n>**NOTE:** Read [this](#custom-resource-installation) document to learn more about the Installation custom resource.\n\n## The installer.sh script\n\nThe `installation/scripts/installer.sh` script creates the default RBAC role, installs [Tiller](https://docs.helm.sh/), and deploys the Kyma Installer component.\n\n>**NOTE:** For the Kyma Installer deployment details, refer to the `installation/resources/installer.yaml` file.\n\nThe script applies the Installation custom resource and marks it with the `action=install` label, which triggers the Kyma installation.\n\nIn the process of installing Tiller, a set of TLS certificates is created and saved to [Helm Home](https://helm.sh/docs/glossary/#helm-home-helm-home) to secure the connection between the client and the server.\n\n>**NOTE:** The Kyma installation runs in the background. Execute the `./installation/scripts/is-installed.sh` script to follow the installation process.\n\n## The is-installed.sh script\n\nThe `installation/scripts/is-installed.sh` script shows the status of Kyma installation in real time. The script checks the status of the Installation custom resource. When it detects that the status changed to `Installed`, the script exits. If you define a timeout period and the status doesn't change to `Installed` within that period, the script fetches the Installer logs.

The `minikube mount` feature allows you to mount a directory from your local disk into the local Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThis tutorial shows how to use this feature, using the service example implemented in Golang.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nInstall [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\n## Steps\n\n### Install the example on your local machine\n\n1. Install the example:\n```shell\ngo get -insecure github.com/kyma-project/examples/http-db-service\n```\n2. Navigate to installed example and the `http-db-service` folder inside it:\n```shell\ncd ~/go/src/github.com/kyma-project/examples/http-db-service\n```\n3. Build the executable to run the application:\n```shell\nCGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main .\n```\n\n### Mount the example directory into Minikube\n\nFor this step, you need a running local Kyma instance. Read [this](#installation-install-kyma-locally-from-the-release) document to learn how to install Kyma locally.\n\n1. Open the terminal window. Do not close it until the development finishes.\n2.

You can immediately see all the changes made in a local Kyma installation based on Minikube, without building a Docker image and publishing it to a Docker registry, such as the Docker Hub.\n\nUsing the same example service, this tutorial explains how to build a Docker image for your service, publish it to the Docker registry, and deploy it to the local Kyma installation. The instructions base on Minikube, but you can also use the image that you create and the Kubernetes resource definitions that you use on the Kyma cluster.\n\n>**NOTE:** The deployment works both on local Kyma installation and on the Kyma cluster.\n\n## Steps\n\n### Build a Docker image\n\nThe `http-db-service` example used in this guide provides you with the `Dockerfile` necessary for building Docker images. Examine the `Dockerfile` to learn how it looks and how it uses the Docker Multistaging feature, but do not use it one-to-one for production. There might be custom `LABEL` attributes with values to override.\n\n1. In your terminal, go to the `examples/http-db-service` directory. If you did not follow the [Sample service deployment on local](#tutorials-sample-service-deployment-on-local) guide and you do not have this directory locally, get the `http-db-service` example from the [`examples`](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples) repository.\n2. Run the build with `./build.sh`.\n\n>**NOTE:** Ensure that the new image builds and is available in your local Docker registry by calling `docker images`. Find an image called `example-http-db-service` and tagged as `latest`.\n\n### Register the image in the Docker Hub\n\nThis guide bases on Docker Hub. However, there are many other Docker registries available. You can use a private Docker registry, but it must be available in the Internet. For more details about using a private Docker registry, see the [this](#tutorials-publish-a-service-docker-image-and-deploy-it-to-kyma) document.\n\n1. Open the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) webpage.\n2. Provide all of the required details and sign up.\n\n### Sign in to the Docker Hub registry in the terminal\n\n1. Call `docker login`.\n2. Provide the username and password, and select the `ENTER` key.\n\n### Push the image to the Docker Hub\n\n1. Tag the local image with a proper name required in the registry: `docker tag example-http-db-service {USERNAME}/example-http-db-service:0.0.1`.\n2. Push the image to the registry: `docker push {USERNAME}/example-http-db-service:0.0.1`.\n\n>**NOTE:** To verify if the image is successfully published, check if it is available online at the following address: `https://hub.docker.com/r/{USERNAME}/example-http-db-service/`\n\n### Deploy to Kyma\n\nThe `http-db-service` example contains sample Kubernetes resource definitions needed for the basic Kyma deployment. Find them in the `deployment` folder. Perform the following modifications to use your newly-published image in the local Kyma installation:\n\n1. Go to the `deployment` directory.\n2. Edit the `deployment.yaml` file. Change the **image** attribute to `{USERNAME}/example-http-db-service:0.0.1`.\n3. Create the new resources in local Kyma using these commands: `kubectl create -f deployment.yaml -n stage && kubectl create -f ingress.yaml -n stage`.\n4. Edit your `/etc/hosts` to add the new `http-db-service.kyma.local` host to the list of hosts associated with your `minikube ip`. Follow these steps:\n    - Open a terminal window and run: `sudo vim /etc/hosts`\n    - Select the **i** key to insert a new line at the top of the file.\n    - Add this line: `{YOUR.MINIKUBE.IP} http-db-service.kyma.local`\n    - Type `:wq` and select the **Enter** key to save the changes.\n5. Run this command to check if you can access the service: `curl https://http-db-service.kyma.local/orders`.

The installation is not an interactive process.\n\nTo customize the Kyma installation, the Installer exposes a generic mechanism to configure Helm overrides called **user-defined** overrides.\n\n\n## User-defined overrides\n\nThe Installer finds user-defined overrides by reading the ConfigMaps and Secrets deployed in the `kyma-installer` Namespace and marked with the `installer:overrides` Label.\n\nThe Installer constructs a single override by inspecting the ConfigMap or Secret entry key name. The key name should be a dot-separated sequence of strings corresponding to the structure of keys in the chart's `values.yaml` file or the entry in chart's template. See the examples below.\n\nInstaller merges all overrides recursively into a single YAML stream and passes it to Helm during the Kyma installation/upgrade operation.\n\n\n## Common vs component overrides\n\nThe Installer looks for available overrides each time a component installation or update operation is due.\nOverrides for the component are composed from two sets: **common** overrides and **component-specific** overrides.\n\nKyma uses common overrides for the installation of all components. ConfigMaps and Secrets marked with the label `installer:overrides`, contain the definition. They require no additional label.\n\nKyma uses component-specific overrides only for the installation of specific components. ConfigMaps and Secrets marked with both `installer:overrides` and `component: <name>` Labels, where `<name>` is the component name, contain the definition. Component-specific overrides have precedence over Common ones in case of conflicting entries.\n\n\n## Overrides Examples\n\n### Top-level charts overrides\n\nOverrides for top-level charts are straightforward. Just use the template value from the chart (without leading \".Values.\" prefix) as the entry key in the ConfigMap or Secret.\n\nExample:\n\nThe Installer uses a `core` top-level chart that contains a template with the following value reference:\n```\nmemory: {{ .Values.test.acceptance.ui.requests.memory }}\n```\nThe chart's default value `test.acceptance.ui.requests.memory` in the `values.yaml` file resolves the template.\nThe following fragment of `values.yaml` shows this definition:\n```\ntest:\n  acceptance:\n    ui:\n      requests:\n        memory: \"1Gi\"\n```\n\nTo override this value, for example to \"2Gi\", proceed as follows:\n- Create a ConfigMap in the `kyma-installer` Namespace, labelled with: `installer:overrides` (or reuse an existing one).\n- Add an entry `test.acceptance.ui.requests.memory: 2Gi` to the map.\n\nOnce the installation starts, the Installer generates overrides based on the map entries. The system uses the value of \"2Gi\" instead of the default \"1Gi\" from the chart `values.yaml` file.\n\nFor overrides that the system should keep in Secrets, just define a Secret object instead of a ConfigMap with the same key and a base64-encoded value. Be sure to label the Secret with `installer:overrides`.\n\n\n### Sub-chart overrides\n\nOverrides for sub-charts follow the same convention as top-level charts. However, overrides require additional information about sub-chart location.\n\nWhen a sub-chart contains the `values.yaml` file, the information about the chart location is not necessary because the chart and it's `values.yaml` file are on the same level in the directory hierarchy.\n\nThe situation is different when the Installer installs a chart with sub-charts.\nAll template values for a sub-chart must be prefixed with a sub-chart \"path\" that is relative to the top-level \"parent\" chart.\n\nThis is not an Installer-specific requirement. The same considerations apply when you provide overrides manually using the `helm` command-line tool.\n\nHere is an example.\nThere's a `core` top-level chart, that the Installer installs.\nThere's an `application-connector` sub-chart in `core` with another nested sub-chart: `connector-service`.\nIn one of its templates there's a following fragment (shortened):\n\n```\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}\n\targs:\n\t  - \"/connectorservice\"\n\t  - '--appName={{ .Chart.Name }}'\n\t  - \"--domainName={{ .Values.global.domainName }}\"\n\t  - \"--tokenExpirationMinutes={{ .Values.deployment.args.tokenExpirationMinutes }}\"\n```\n\nThe following fragment of the `values.yaml` file in `connector-service` chart defines the default value for `tokenExpirationMinutes`:\n\n```\ndeployment:\n  args:\n    tokenExpirationMinutes: 60\n```\n\nTo override this value, such as to change \"60 to \"90\", do the following:\n\n- Create a ConfigMap in the `kyma-installer` Namespace labeled with `installer:overrides` or reuse existing one.\n- Add an entry `application-connector.connector-service.deployment.args.tokenExpirationMinutes: 90` to the map.\n\nNotice that the user-provided override key now contains two parts:\n\n- The chart \"path\" inside the top-level `core` chart: `application-connector.connector-service`\n- The original template value reference from the chart without the .Values. prefix: `deployment.args.tokenExpirationMinutes`.\n\nOnce the installation starts, the Installer generates overrides based on the map entries. The system uses the value of \"90\" instead of the default value of \"60\" from the `values.yaml` chart file.\n\n\n## Global overrides\n\nThere are several important parameters usually shared across the charts.\nHelm convention to provide these requires the use of the `global` override key.\nFor example, to define the `global.domain` override, just use \"global.domain\" as the name of the key in ConfigMap or Secret for the Installer.\n\nOnce the installation starts, the Installer merges all of the map entries and collects all of the global entries under the `global` top-level key to use for installation.\n\n\n## Values and types\n\nInstaller generally recognizes all override values as strings. It internally renders overrides to Helm as a YAML stream with only string values.\n\nThere is one exception to this rule with respect to handling booleans:\nThe system converts \"true\" or \"false\" strings that it encounters to a corresponding boolean value (true/false).\n\n\n## Merging and conflicting entries\n\nWhen the Installer encounters two overrides with the same key prefix, it tries to merge them.\nIf both of them represent a map (they have nested sub-keys), their nested keys are recursively merged.\nIf at least one of keys points to a final value, the Installer performs the merge in a non-deterministic order, so either one of the overrides is rendered in the final YAML data.\n\nIt is important to avoid overrides having the same keys for final values.\n\n\n### Example of non-conflicting merge:\n\nTwo overrides with a common key prefix (\"a.b\"):\n\n```\n\"a.b.c\": \"first\"\n\"a.b.d\": \"second\"\n```\n\nThe Installer yields correct output:\n\n```\na:\n  b:\n    c: first\n    d: second\n```\n\n### Example of conflicting merge:\n\nTwo overrides with the same key (\"a.b\"):\n\n```\n\"a.b\": \"first\"\n\"a.b\": \"second\"\n```\n\nThe Installer yields either:\n\n```\na:\n  b: \"first\"\n```\n\nOr (due to non-deterministic merge order):\n\n```\na:\n  b: \"second\"\n```\n","type":"Tutorials"},{"order":"12-01-try-out-kyma","title":"Kyma features and concepts in practice","source":"\nThe table contains a list of examples that demonstrate Kyma functionalities.
