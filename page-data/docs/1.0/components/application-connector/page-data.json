No matter if you want to integrate an on-premise or a cloud system, the integration process doesn't change, which allows to avoid any configuration or network-related problems.\n\nThe external solution you connect to Kyma using the AC is represented as an Application (App). There is always a one-to-one relationship between a connected solution and an App, which helps to ensure the highest level of security and separation. This means that you must create five separate Apps in your cluster to connect five different external solutions and use their APIs and Event catalogs in Kyma.\n\nThe AC gives you this functionality:\n\n- Manages the lifecycle of Apps.\n- Establishes a secure connection and generates the client certificate used by the connected external solution.\n- Registers the APIs and the Event catalogs of the connected external solution.\n- Delivers the Events from the connected external solution to the Kyma Event Bus.\n- Proxies calls sent from Kyma to external APIs registered by the connected external solution.\n- Allows to map an App to a Kyma Namespace and use its registered APIs and Event catalogs in the context of that Namespace.\n- Integrates the registered APIs and Event catalogs with the Kyma Service Catalog.\n\nAll of the AC components scale independently, which allows to adjust it to fit the needs of the implementation built using Kyma.\n\n>**NOTE:** To learn more about the concept of Namespaces in Kyma, read [this](/docs/1.0/root/kyma#details-namespaces) document.\n\n## Supported APIs\n\nThe Application Connector allows you to register secured REST APIs exposed by the connected external solution. The Application Connector supports a variety of authentication methods to ensure smooth integration with a wide range of APIs. \n\nYou can register an API secured with one of the following authentication methods:\n\n- Basic Authentication\n- OAuth\n- Client Certificates\n\n> **NOTE:** You can register non-secured APIs for testing purposes, however, it is not recommended in the production environment.\n\nIn addition to authentication methods, the Application Connector supports Cross-Site Request Forgery Tokens.\n\nYou can register any API that adheres to the REST principles and is available over the HTTP protocol. The Application Connector also allows you to register APIs implemented with the OData technology. \n\nYou can provide specifications that document your APIs. The Application Connector supports [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) and [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation) specification formats."},{"order":"02-01-application-connector","title":"Application Connector components","source":"\n![Architecture Diagram](./assets/001-application-connector.svg)\n\n\n## Nginx Ingress Controller\n\nThe Nginx Ingress Controller exposes the Application Connector by assigning a public IP address and a DNS name to it.\nThe DNS name of the Ingress is cluster-dependant and follows the `gateway.{cluster-dns}` format, for example `gateway.servicemanager.cluster.kyma.cx`.\nYou can access every exposed Application (App) through its gateway by using the assigned path. For example, to reach the gateway for the `user-custom` App, use this URL: `gateway.servicemanager.cluster.kyma.cx/user-custom`. The Nginx Ingress Controller secures the endpoint with certificate validation. Each call must include a valid client certificate which is App-specific.\n\n## Connector Service\n\nThe Connector Service:\n- Handles the exchange of client certificates for a given App.\n- Provides the Application Registry and Event Service endpoints.\n- Signs client certificates using the server-side certificate stored in a Kubernetes Secret.\n\n## Application Registry\n\nThe Application Registry saves and reads the APIs and Event Catalog metadata of the connected external solution in the [Application](#custom-resource-application) custom resource.\nThe system creates a new Kubernetes service for each registered API.\n\n>**NOTE:** Using the Application Registry, you can register an API along with its OAuth or Basic Authentication credentials. The credentials are stored in a Kubernetes Secret.\n\n## Event Service\n\nThe Event Service sends Events to the Kyma Event Bus and enriches the Events with metadata that indicates the source of the Event.\nThis allows routing the Events to lambda functions and services based on their source App.\n\n## Application\n\nAn App represents an external solution connected to Kyma. It handles the integration with other components, such as the Service Catalog or the Event Bus.\nUsing the components of the Application Connector, the App creates a coherent identity for a connected external solution and ensures its separation.\nAll Apps are created through the Application custom resource, which also stores all of the relevant metadata. You can map an App to many Kyma Namespaces and use the APIs and the Event Catalogs of the connected external solution within their context.\n\n## Application Broker\n\nThe Application Broker (AB) watches all [Application](#custom-resource-application) custom resources. These custom resources contain definitions of the external solutions’ APIs and Events. The AB exposes those APIs and Events definitions as ServiceClasses to the Service Catalog. When the list of remote ServiceClasses is available in the Service Catalog, you can create an ApplicationMapping, provision those ServiceClasses, and enable them for Kyma services. This allows you to extend the functionality of existing systems.\n\nThe AB implements the [Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/). For more details about Service Brokers, see [this](/docs/1.0/components/service-catalog#service-brokers-service-brokers) documentation.\n\n## Application Operator\n\nThe operator listens for creating or deleting the Application custom resources and acts accordingly, either provisioning or de-provisioning an instance of Application Gateway and Event Service for every custom resource.         \n\n>**NOTE:** Every Application custom resource corresponds to a single App to which you can connect an external solution.\n\n## Application Gateway\n\nThe Application Gateway is an intermediary component between a lambda function or a service and an external API registered with the Application Registry. It can call services secured with:\n- [Basic Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617) mechanism,\n- OAuth\n- Client certificates\n\nAdditionally, the Application Gateway supports cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens as an optional layer of API protection. \n\n## Access Service\n\nThe Access Service exposes the Application Gateway and manages the access from the Lambda functions and services deployed in Kyma to the external APIs over the Application Gateway.\n\n## Asset Store\n\nThe Asset Store stores the documentation of the connected external solution's registered APIs and Event catalogs.\n\n## Kubernetes Secret\n\nThe Kubernetes Secret is a Kubernetes object which stores sensitive data, such as the OAuth credentials.\n","type":"Architecture"},{"order":"02-02-connector-service","title":"Connector Service","source":"\nThe Connector Service generates client certificates which are used to secure the communication between Kyma and the connected external solutions.        \n\nGenerating a new client certificate is the first step in the process of configuring an Application (App). Kyma stores the root certificate and serves as the Certificate Authority when you configure a new App. When you generate a new client certificate, the Connector Service returns it along with the root certificate to allow validation.  \n\nThis diagram illustrates the client certificate generation flow in details:\n![Client certificate generation operation flow](./assets/002-automatic-configuration.svg)\n\n1. The administrator requests for a token using the CLI or the UI and receives a link with the token, which is valid for a limited period of time.\n2. The administrator passes the token to the external system, which requests for information regarding the Kyma installation. In the response, it receives the following information:\n    - the URL to which a third-party solution sends its Certificate Signing Request (CSR)\n    - the URL of the `metadata` endpoint\n    - information required to generate a CSR\n3. The external system generates a CSR based on the information provided by Kyma and sends the CSR to the designated URL. In the response, the external system receives a signed certificate. It can use the certificate to authenticate and safely communicate with Kyma.\n4. The external system calls the `metadata` endpoint that contains the following information:\n    - the URL of the Application Registry API\n    - the URL of the Event Service API\n    - the certificate renewal URL used to rotate certificates\n    - the certificate revocation URL used to revoke compromised certificates\n    - information uniquely identifying certificate, such as the Application name\n    - information required to generate a CSR  \n\n>**NOTE:** The external application should not hardcode any URLs. The information returned from the `metadata` endpoint should be stored by the external application along with the certificate. This approach implicates less coupling and offers a great deal of flexibility. \n\n>**NOTE:**  The external application can call the `metadata` endpoint to fetch information required to generate a CSR prior to certificate renewal. This approach makes certificate rotation process convenient and flexible, since the external application does not need to store information required to generate a CSR in its data model.     \n\n>**NOTE:** Follow [this](#tutorials-get-the-client-certificate) tutorial to learn how to get a client certificate for your implementation.\n","type":"Architecture"},{"order":"02-03-proxy-service","title":"Application Gateway","source":"\nThe Application Gateway sends the requests from Lambda functions and services in Kyma to external APIs registered with the Application Registry. The Application Gateway works in conjunction with the Access Service, which exposes the Application Gateway.\n\n>**NOTE:** The system creates an Access Service for every external API registered by the Application Registry.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how the Application Gateway interacts with other components and external APIs\nwhich are either unsecured or secured with various security mechanisms and protected against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.\n\n![Application Gateway Diagram](./assets/003-architecture-proxy-service.svg)\n\n1. A lambda function calls the Access Service. The name of every Access Service follows this format: `app-{application-name}-{service-id}`\n2. The Access Service exposes the Application Gateway.\n3. The Application Gateway extracts the Application name and the service ID from the name of the Access Service name. Using the extracted Application name, the Application Gateway finds the respective Application custom resource and obtains the information about the registered external API, such as the API URL and security credentials.\n4. The Application Gateway gets a token from the OAuth server.\n5. The Application Gateway gets a CSRF token from the endpoint exposed by the upstream service. This step is optional and is valid only for the API which was registered with a CSRF token turned on.\n6. The Application Gateway calls the target API.\n\n## Caching\n\nTo ensure optimal performance, the Application Gateway caches the OAuth tokens and CSRF tokens it obtains. If the service doesn't find valid tokens for the call it makes, it gets new tokens from the OAuth server and the CSRF token endpoint.\nAdditionally, the service caches ReverseProxy objects used to proxy the requests to the underlying URL.\n\n## Handling of headers\n\nThe Application Gateway removes the following headers while making calls to the registered applications:\n\n- `X-Forwarded-Proto`\n- `X-Forwarded-For`\n- `X-Forwarded-Host`\n- `X-Forwarded-Client-Cert`\n\nIn addition, the `User-Agent` header is set to an empty value not specified in the call, which prevents from setting the default value.\n","type":"Architecture"},{"order":"02-04-application-broker","title":"Application Broker","source":"\nThe Application Broker (AB) workflow consists of the following steps:\n\n1. The Application Broker watches for Applications (Apps) in the cluster and ApplicationMappings (AMs) in all Namespaces.\n2. The user creates an ApplicationMapping custom resource in a given Namespace. The AM activates services offered by an App. The AM must have the same name as the App.\n3. The Application Broker creates an `application-broker` Service Broker (SB) inside the Namespace in which the AM is created. This Service Broker contains data of all services provided by the activated Applications. There is always only one `application-broker` Service Broker per Namespace, even if there are more AMs.\n4. The Service Catalog fetches services that the `application-broker` Service Broker exposes.\n5. The Service Catalog creates a ServiceClass for each service received from the Service Broker.\n\n![AB architecture](./assets/004-AB-architecture.svg)\n\nWhen this process is complete, you can provision and bind your services.\n\n## Provisioning and binding for an API ServiceClass\n\nThis ServiceClass has a **bindable** flag set to `true` which means that you have to provision a ServiceInstance and bind it to the service or lambda to connect to the given API. The provisioning and binding workflow for an API ServiceClass consists of the following steps:\n1. Select an API ServiceClass from the Service Catalog.\n2. Provision this ServiceClass by creating its ServiceInstance in a Namespace.\n3. Bind your ServiceInstance to the service or lambda. During the binding process, ServiceBinding and ServiceBindingUsage resources are created.\n    * ServiceBinding contains a Secret with a GatewayURL required to connect to the given API.\n    * ServiceBindingUsage injects the Secret, together with the label given during the registration process, to the lambda or service.\n4. The service or lambda calls the API through the Application Connector. The Application Connector verifies the label to check if you have the authorization to access this API.\n5. After verifying the label, the Application Connector allows you to access the Application API.\n\n![API Service Class](./assets/005-AB-API-service-class.svg)\n\n## Provisioning and binding for an Event ServiceClass\n\nThis ServiceClass has a **bindable** flag set to `false` which means that after provisioning a ServiceClass in the Namespace, given Events are ready to use for all services. The provisioning workflow for an Event ServiceClass consists of the following steps:\n1. Select a given Event ServiceClass from the Service Catalog.\n2. Provision this ServiceClass by creating a ServiceInstance in the given Namespace.\n3. During the provisioning process, the EventActivation resource is created together with the ServiceInstance. EventActivation allows you to create an Event Bus Subscription.\n4. A Subscription is a custom resource by which an Event Bus triggers the lambda for a particular type of Event in this step.\n5. The Application sends an Event to the Application Connector.\n6. The Application Connector sends an Event to the lambda through the Event Bus.\n\n\n![Event Service Class](./assets/006-AB-event-service-class.svg)\n\n## Provisioning and binding for both the API and Event ServiceClass\n\nThis ServiceClass has a **bindable** flag set to `true`.\nThe provisioning and binding workflow for both the API and Event ServiceClass is a combination of steps described for an [API ServiceClass](#architecture-the-application-broker-architecture-provisioning-and-binding-for-an-api-serviceclass) and an [Event ServiceClass](#architecture-the-application-broker-architecture-provisioning-and-binding-for-an-event-serviceclass).\n","type":"Architecture"},{"order":"03-01-ac-security","title":"Security","source":"\n## Client certificates\n\nTo provide maximum security, the Application Connector uses TLS protocol with Client Authentication enabled. As a result, whoever wants to connect to the Application Connector must present a valid client certificate, which is dedicated to a specific Application (App). In this way, the traffic is fully encrypted and the client has a valid identity.\n\n## Disable SSL certificate verification\n\nYou can disable the SSL certificate verification in the communication between Kyma and an App to allow Kyma to send requests and data to an unsecured App. Disabling the certificate verification can be useful in certain testing scenarios.\n\n>**NOTE:** By default, the SSL certificate verification is enabled when sending data and requests to every App.\n\nFollow these steps to disable SSL certificate verification for communication between Kyma and an existing App:\n\n  1. Edit the `{APPLICATION}-application-gateway` Deployment in the `kyma-integration` Namespace. Run:\n    ```\n    kubectl -n kyma-integration edit deployment {APPLICATION}-application-gateway\n    ```\n  2. Edit the Deployment in Vim. Select `i` to start editing.\n  3. Find the **skipVerify** parameter and change its value to `true`.\n  4. Select `esc`, type `:wq`, and select `enter` to write and quit.\n\n## Override the API security type\n\nThe Application Registry allows you to register APIs:\n- Secured with [Basic Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617)\n- Secured with OAuth flow\n- Secured with client certificates\n- Not secured\n- Protected against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks\n\nThe Application Gateway calls the registered APIs accordingly, basing on the security type specified in the API registration process.\n\nThe Application Gateway overrides the registered APIs security type if it gets a request which contains the **Access-Token** header. In such a case, the Application Gateway rewrites the token from the **Access-Token** header into an OAuth-compliant **Authorization** header and forwards it to the target API.\n\nThis mechanism is suited for implementations in which an external application handles user authentication.\n\nSee [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/master/call-ec) example to see such an implementation in action.\n","type":"Details"},{"order":"03-02-access-ac-on-local","title":"Access the Application Connector on a local Kyma deployment","source":"\nTo access the Application Connector on a local deployment of Kyma, you must add the Kyma server certificate to the trusted certificate storage of your programming environment.

The ID assigned to the API in the registration process is `01a702b8-e302-4e62-b678-8d361b627e49`.\n\nThe Application Broker, which provides ServiceClasses to the Service Catalog, follows this naming convention for its objects:\n```\napp-{application-name}-{service-id}\n```\nThe `{service-id}` is the service identifier assigned in the process of registration. The `{application}` is the name of the App created in Kyma. It represents an instance of the connected external solution that owns the registered service.

The controller which handles this CR kind adds the **status** section to the created CR. The **status** section contains the required configuration details.\n\n- Create a TokenRequest CR.

Use the value of the `api.infoUrl` property to get the URL. Run:\n\n```\ncurl {CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/v1/applications/management/info --cert {CERT_FILE_NAME}.crt --key {KEY_FILE_NAME}.key\n```\n\nA successful call returns the following response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"clientIdentity\": {\n    \"application\": \"{APP_NAME}\"\n  },\n  \"urls\": {\n    \"metadataUrl\": \"https://gateway.{CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/{APP_NAME}/v1/metadata/services\",\n    \"eventsUrl\": \"https://gateway.{CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/{APP_NAME}/v1/events\",\n    \"renewCertUrl\": \"https://gateway.{CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/v1/applications/certificates/renewals\",\n    \"revokeCertUrl\": \"https://gateway.{CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/v1/applications/certificates/revocations\"\n  },\n  \"certificate\": {\n    \"subject\": \"OU=Test,O=Test,L=Blacksburg,ST=Virginia,C=US,CN={APP_NAME}\",\n    \"extensions\": \"string\",\n    \"key-algorithm\": \"rsa2048\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUse `urls.metadataUrl` and `urls.eventsUrl` to get the URLs to the Application Registry API and to the Events API.\n\n## Call the Application Registry and Event services on local deployment\n\nWhen you connect an external solution to a local Kyma deployment, you must pass the NodePort of the `application-connector-ingress-nginx-ingress-controller` to successfully call the Application Registry and the Event Service.\n\n- To get the NodePort, run:\n  ```\n  kubectl -n kyma-system get svc application-connector-ingress-nginx-ingress-controller -o 'jsonpath={.spec.ports[?(@.port==443)].nodePort}'\n  ```\n- When you send requests to the Application Registry and the Event Service, pass the NodePort along with the generated certificate and key.

The supported authentication methods are [Basic Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617), [OAuth](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750), and client certificates.\n\nYou can specify only one authentication method for every secured API you register. If you try to register and specify more than one authentication method, the Application Registry returns a `400` code response.\n\nAdditionally, you can secure the API against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. CSRF tokens are an additional layer of protection and can accompany any authentication method.  \n\n>**NOTE:** Registering a secured API is a part of registering services of an external solution connected to Kyma. To learn more about this process, follow [this](#tutorials-register-a-service) tutorial.\n\n## Register a Basic Authentication-secured API\n\nTo register an API secured with Basic Authentication, add a `credentials.basic` object to the `api` section of the service registration request body. You must include these fields:\n\n| Field   |  Description |\n|:----------:|:------|\n| **username** | Basic Authorization username |\n| **password** | Basic Authorization password |\n\nThis is an example of the `api` section of the request body for an API secured with Basic Authentication:\n\n```\n    \"api\": {\n        \"targetUrl\": \"https://sampleapi.targeturl/v1\",\n        \"credentials\": {\n            \"basic\": {\n                \"username\": \"{USERNAME}\",\n                \"password\": \"{PASSWORD}\"\n            },\n        }  \n```\n## Register an OAuth-secured API\n\nTo register an API secured with OAuth, add a `credentials.oauth` object to the `api` section of the service registration request body. You must include these fields:\n\n| Field   |  Description |\n|:----------:|:------|\n| **url** |  OAuth token exchange endpoint of the service |\n| **clientId** | OAuth client ID |\n| **clientSecret** | OAuth client Secret |    \n\nThis is an example of the `api` section of the request body for an API secured with OAuth:\n\n```\n    \"api\": {\n        \"targetUrl\": \"https://sampleapi.targeturl/v1\",\n        \"credentials\": {\n            \"oauth\": {\n                \"url\": \"https://sampleapi.targeturl/authorizationserver/oauth/token\",\n                \"clientId\": \"{CLIENT_ID}\",\n                \"clientSecret\": \"{CLIENT_SECRET}\"\n            },\n        }  \n```\n\n## Register a client certificate-secured API\n\nTo register an API and secure it with client certificates, you must add the `credentials.certificateGen` object to the `api` section of the service registration request body. The Application Registry generates a ready to use certificate and key pair for every API registered this way. You can use the generated pair or replace it with your own certificate and key.\n\nInclude this field in the service registration request body:\n\n| Field   |  Description |\n|:----------:|:------|\n| **commonName** |  Name of the generated certificate. Set as the `CN` field of the certificate Subject.  |\n\nThis is an example of the `api` section of the request body for an API secured with generated client certificates:\n\n```\n    \"api\": {\n        \"targetUrl\": \"https://sampleapi.targeturl/v1\",\n        \"credentials\": {\n            \"certificateGen\": {\n                \"commonName\": \"{CERT_NAME}\"\n            },\n        }  \n```\n\n>**NOTE:** If you update the registered API and change the `certificateGen.commonName`, the Application Registry generates a new certificate-key pair for that API. When you delete an API secured with generated client certificates, the Application Registry deletes the corresponding certificate and key.\n\n### Details\n\nWhen you register an API with the `credentials.certificateGen` object, the Application Registry generates a SHA256withRSA-encrypted certificate and a matching key. To enable communication between Kyma and an API secured with this authentication method, set the certificate as a valid authentication medium for all calls coming from Kyma in your external solution.\n\nYou can retrieve the client certificate by sending the following request:\n```\ncurl https://gateway.{CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/{APP_NAME}/v1/metadata/services/{YOUR_SERVICE_ID} --cert {CERT_FILE_NAME}.crt --key {KEY_FILE_NAME}.key -k\n```\nA successful call will return a response body with the details of a registered service and a base64-encoded client certificate.\n\nThe certificate and key pair is stored in a Secret in the `kyma-integration` Namespace. List all Secrets and find the one created for your API:\n\n```\nkubectl -n kyma-integration get secrets\n```\n\nTo fetch the certificate and key encoded with base64, run this command:\n\n```\nkubectl -n kyma-integration get secrets app-{APP_NAME}-{SERVICE_ID} -o yaml\n```\n\n>**NOTE:** Replace the `APP_NAME` placeholder with the name of the Application used to connect the external solution that is the origin of the API. Replace the `SERVICE_ID` placeholder with the ID of the registered service to which the API belongs. You get this ID after you register an external solution's service in Kyma.\n\n\nIf the API you registered provides a certificate-key pair or the generated certificate doesn't meet your security standards or specific needs, you can use a custom certificate-key pair for authentication.

As a result, the certificate is stored in two separate Secrets:\n  - The `connector-service-app-ca` Connector Service CA Secret responsible for signing certificate requests\n  - The `nginx-auth-ca` Nginx Ingress Secret responsible for security in the Connector Service API\n\nKeeping both Secrets up-to-date is vital for the security of your implementation as it guarantees that the Connector Service issues proper certificates and no unregistered applications can access its API.\n\nThe Root CA certificate has a set expiration date and must be renewed periodically to prevent its expiration. You must also renew the Root CA certificate and key every time they are compromised.\n\nThis tutorial describes the procedure you must follow for these scenarios:\n  - Rotating a soon-to-expire Root CA certificate\n  - Rotating a compromised Root CA certificate\n  - Rotating a compromised Root CA key\n\n## Rotating a soon-to-expire CA certificate\n\nTo successfully rotate a soon-to-expire CA certificate, replace it with a new certificate in both the Connector Service CA Secret and the Nginx Ingress Secret. Follow these steps to replace the old certificate in both Secrets:\n\n1. Get the existing Root CA key. Fetch it from the `connector-service-app-ca` Secret and save it to a `ca.key` file. Run:\n  ```\n  kubectl -n kyma-integration get secret connector-service-app-ca -o=jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.key}' | base64 -D > ca.key\n  ```\n\n2. Generate a new certificate for the key you obtained and save it to a `new-ca.crt` file. Run:\n\n  ```\n  openssl req -new -key ca.key -x509 -sha256 -days {TTL_DAYS} -nodes -out new-ca.crt\n  ```\n\n>**NOTE:** Use the `-days` flag to set the TTL of the newly generated certificate.\n\n3. Encode the newly created certificate with base64:\n  ```\n  cat new-ca.crt | base64\n  ```\n\n4. Replace the old certificate in the Connector Service CA Secret. Edit the Secret and replace the `ca.crt` value with the new base64-encoded certificate. Run:\n  ```\n  kubectl -n kyma-integration edit secret connector-service-app-ca\n  ```\n\n5. Get the existing Nginx Ingress Secret. Fetch it from the `nginx-auth-ca` Secret and save it to a `old-ca.crt` file. Run:\n  ```\n  kubectl -n kyma-integration get secret nginx-auth-ca -o=jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}' | base64 -D > old-ca.crt\n  ```\n\n6. Merge the old Nginx certificate and the newly generated certificate into a single `nginx-ca.crt` file:\n  ```\n  cat old-ca.crt > nginx-ca.crt\n  cat new-ca.crt >> nginx-ca.crt\n  ```\n\n7. Encode the newly created `nginx-ca.crt` certificate file with base64:\n  ```\n  cat nginx-ca.crt | base64\n  ```\n\n8. Replace the old certificate in the Nginx Ingress Secret. Edit the Secret and replace the `ca.crt` value with the `nginx-ca.crt` base64-encoded certificate. Run:\n  ```\n  kubectl -n kyma-integration edit secret nginx-auth-ca\n  ```\n\n9. Renew the certificates in a runtime. To do that, create a CertificateRequest CR in the runtime in which you want to renew the certificates. Alternatively, wait for the certificates to expire in a given runtime. The system renews the certificates automatically using the information stored in the Secrets you updated.\n\n\n10. After the certificates are renewed in a runtime, remove the `nginx-auth-ca` Secret entry which contains the old certificate. First, encode the `new-ca.crt` file with base64:\n  ```\n  cat new-ca.crt | base64\n  ```\n\n11. Edit the Secret and replace the `ca.crt` value with the `new-ca.crt` base64-encoded certificate. Run:\n  ```\n  kubectl -n kyma-integration edit secret nginx-auth-ca\n  ```\n\n## Rotating a compromised Root CA certificate\n\n1. Get the existing Root CA key. Fetch it from the `connector-service-app-ca` Secret and save it to a `ca.key` file. Run:\n  ```\n  kubectl -n kyma-integration get secret connector-service-app-ca -o=jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.key}' | base64 -D > ca.key\n  ```\n\n2. Generate a new certificate for the key you obtained and save it to a `new-ca.crt` file. Run:\n\n  ```\n  openssl req -new -key ca.key -x509 -sha256 -days {TTL_DAYS} -nodes -out new-ca.crt\n  ```\n\n>**NOTE:** Use the `-days` flag to set the TTL of the newly generated certificate.\n\n3. Encode the newly created certificate with base64:\n  ```\n  cat new-ca.crt | base64\n  ```\n\n4. Replace the old certificate in the Connector Service CA Secret. Edit the Secret and replace `ca.crt` value with the new base64-encoded certificate. Run:\n  ```\n  kubectl -n kyma-integration edit secret connector-service-app-ca\n  ```\n\n5. Replace the old certificate in the Nginx Ingress Secret. Edit the Secret and replace the `ca.crt` value with the new base64-encoded certificate. Run:\n  ```\n  kubectl -n kyma-integration edit secret nginx-auth-ca\n  ```\n\n6. Renew the certificates in a runtime. To do that, create a CertificateRequest CR in the runtime in which you want to renew the certificates.\n\n## Rotating a compromised root CA key\n\n1. Generate a new, RSA-encoded root CA key and save to a `new-ca.key` file:\n  ```\n  openssl genrsa -out new-ca.key 2048\n  ```\n\n2. Generate a new certificate using the key you generated and save it to a `new-ca.crt` file. Run:\n\n  ```\n  openssl req -new -key ca.key -x509 -sha256 -days {EXPIRATION_DAYS} -nodes -out new-ca.crt\n  ```\n\n>**NOTE:** Use the `-days` flag to set the TTL of the newly generated certificate.\n\n3. Encode the newly created certificate and key with base64:\n  ```\n  cat new-ca.key | base64\n  ```\n  ```\n  cat new-ca.crt | base64\n  ```\n\n4. Replace the old certificate and key in the Connector Service CA Secret. Edit the Secret and replace the `ca.crt` and `ca.key` values with the new base64-encoded certificate and key respectively. Run:\n  ```\n  kubectl -n kyma-integration edit secret connector-service-app-ca\n  ```\n\n5. Replace the old certificate in the Nginx Ingress Secret.
